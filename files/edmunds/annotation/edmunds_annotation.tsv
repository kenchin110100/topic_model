0	0	I've been driving my new Rav for about a month now, and I'll admit I've been surprised (in both good and bad ways) Good (With 4cyl): Incredible gas mileage
0	1	I average ~30mpg interstate (with cruise control going 65mph) If I go up to 72mph, I drop to around 24/25mpg so the trick is to keep it slow
0	2	Additionally I can get a solid 34mpg doing 55mph on more rural travels
0	3	I also use the aux jack constantly with my MP3 player, don't know how I went 9 years without one
0	4	We had aftermarket heated seats installed in the cloth seats, nice in Pennsylvania! Bad: The cloth seats are NOT comfortable, sure, they could be worse (i.e
0	5	Subaru) but it may be worthwhile to go for leather.
1	6	This is my 3rd MDX
1	7	Great vehicle, reliable, comfortable, quick and fun to drive
1	8	Dollar for dollar there is no better SUV on the market today
1	9	I have put about 100,000 miles on the 3 MDX's with few if any problems
1	10	My only real gripe is that the few problems I have had, have been dealt with poorly
1	11	The service departments of the Acura dealers are well below par, in fact they are poor
1	12	This is my 4th Acura in 7 years and as much as I love the vehicles, because of the quality of Acura's service, this will probably be my last
1	13	Honda get your act together you ain't no Lexus.
2	14	I've had my new Outback Sport for a few weeks now and have been very satisfied with it so far
2	15	I'm still getting used to the different (read: better) handling of the AWD
2	16	I test drove roughly similar vehicles (Honda Fit and VW Rabbit) and this Subaru, while more expensive, just felt much more intuitive and well thought-out
2	17	The seat warmers are nice and standard on this trim
2	18	The fuel economy is better than expected (26-27 mpg city+highway), even this early in the car's lifetime.
3	19	Did the NCM (R8C) delivery on 10-23- 08
3	20	After hearing the car rolled off on 9-23-08 I was like a kid waiting for Christmas
3	21	I arrived with my sister and dad
3	22	The delivery experience was super
3	23	NCM guide was awesome
3	24	Drove 3000 miles back to Seattle via Chicago, Denver, Boise, and then Seattle
3	25	I could not be happier
3	26	Over the entire trip I averaged over 28mpg! Road noise was not an issue
3	27	Wish all my cars had a HUD, hands free Bluetooth, XM radio and 505 hp! The hardest part is keeping the smile off my face
3	28	Heard a lot of negative items about the car like road noise, steering, ect.
3	29	Nope, 125% satisfied with my Z06.
4	30	Since purchasing this SUV I've been more than pleased
4	31	It makes driving fun again
4	32	It's roomy but sleek on the inside
4	33	I've found that it has plenty of power for everyday driving and I've averaged 20 MPG so far (both city & HWY)
4	34	After driving domestic cars my whole life I can now see why they are in so much trouble
4	35	The Honda Pilot is best in its class in my opinion.
5	36	Turbo 4 provides plenty acceleration with good gas mileage
5	37	Handling is unreal
5	38	Considered the BMW 328 and Cadillac CTS
5	39	Both were great but did not appear worth the extra cost (insurance, maintenance and purchase price)
6	40	Before I bought it I test drove Infinity G35, M35 and Acura TL
6	41	I even brought Infinity M35 to Hyundai dealership, parked both cars next to each other, opened all doors and trunk and almost compared each inch of the cars
6	42	"I am waking up every morning and thinking: ""I will be driving Genesis today again!"" Incredible car!"
6	43	Some previous reviewers seems like didn't read car manual
6	44	Side mirrors reverse tilt down can be switched OFF, trunk has push button right above license plate (slightly to the right).
7	45	Bought this car last weekend
7	46	I love the power the V6 provides
7	47	The ride is nice and smooth and the SE sport package really adds to the look of the car
7	48	"I got it in black with the 17"" rims and love the way it looks!"
8	49	The body of this car is by far the best looking on the road today
8	50	And Deep Sea Blue is the most beautiful color I?ve seen
8	51	In the shade it looks black, but in the sunlight it?s a gorgeous three dimensional metallic shade of dark blue
8	52	I think the darker colors bring out the lines better than the lighter ones, but I?ve read other reviews that say the opposite
8	53	The conclusion: the car has awesome lines regardless of color
8	54	The MMI isn?t as confusing as some reviews say; however, most actions are a two-step process
8	55	It?s a little more work, but there are SO many options for comfort, information, entertainment, etc
8	56	If you?re considering this car, go drive one, you?ll love it
9	57	I seriously considered (and test-drove) the Toyota Avalon, the Lexus ES330/350 and IS250, and the Maxima was just a better overall vehicle
9	58	It's comfortable, stylish, feature-rich, and extremely fun to drive
9	59	The CVT transmission is very responsive, the engine has ample power, handles like a sports car, yet has room for 4 people (it has seat belts for 5, but the 5th one had better be a midget)
9	60	I fell in love with the iPod integration immediately, and the center console computer (I didn't buy the nav) has bucketloads of information if you desire info
9	61	I can't say enough about how I enjoy the SmartKey (breaking the habit of taking out a key was easier than I thought)
9	62	Terrific vehicle! 
10	63	Traded a BMW 745i for a Toyota Hybrid
10	64	With gas approaching $4 for premium it was time for a change! Tested Prius but could not make the transition with hardly any creature comforts available in this region
10	65	Didn't discover the Camry until the last minute
10	66	Customer reviews here and elsewhere on the web boast how great this car is so I went to take a test drive
10	67	Truly, I thought I would give up a lot to save gas and the environment but instead was quite surprised! Got the hybrid fully loaded and couldn't be happier
10	68	"Every day I ask myself, ""what took me so long!"" Get a Camry Hybrid!!"
11	69	The car is beautifully crafted with subtle elegance
11	70	The AWD worked superbly in snow and ice
11	71	The vehicle is quiet, responsive, and thoughtfully designed, inside and out
11	72	The voice command system is a marvel and requires little more than a quick read through the manual
11	73	Like other buyers, I would have expected leather at this price
11	74	That is the one area where MB falls short.
12	75	Buyer Beware of transmission problems
12	76	"The transmission ""slipped"" on my brand new 2009 Saturn Aura at 347 miles"
12	77	I had to have it towed twice
12	78	The dealership returned it to me and assured me there was nothing wrong, despite the fact that I pulled out in front of traffic and could not accelerate
12	79	"I was told to ""...pull off to the side of the road, shut off the engine, then restart the car to 'reset' it."" After this occurred the third time, I did as instructed, then drove it to the dealership, and left it there"
12	80	I insisted it was dangerous, and I was now following the GA Lemon Law
12	81	They replaced the transmission at approximately 700 miles
12	82	I would rate my experience with Saturn a big 0.
13	83	Update from 12-08,purchased new 9- 08.G8 continues to perform flawlessly,was able to do a home oil & filter change(simple no problem d riving on ramps).19 in tires were wearing more on out side of tires
13	84	had a 4 wheel allignment done underwarranty, hope that works, tires are pricey.Gas mileage has remained pretty constant averaging about 20 mpg in my mixed driving
13	85	Like some other reviews I really hope GM finds a way to save this car(Ihave faith in bob lutz)we have seriously considered a second g8., but at 67 I doubt it.
14	86	This car has been nothing but a headache since a month after we purchased it
14	87	It had an axel seal to bust causing oil to leak on the exhaust, the transmission is always shifting gears, sometimes it wont shift down when going up hills, then when it does shift down it wont shift back up, it down shifts to low gear while in cruise control going 70 mph on the interstate & almost got us hit,Chrysler says that's the way the car is designed to work, power steering whins all the time, Chrysler says that is normal also
14	88	Any problem that this car has Chrysler says it is normal so it doesn't do any good to call them with your problems
14	89	All i can say is LEMON, this car should have been YELLOW.
15	90	Was going to get a Yaris sedan
15	91	My wife just got one and I really liked it, but there nowhere to be found
15	92	Glad I tried this baby
15	93	I traded in My 2001 Mustang that was in great shape, but the winters are getting tough for me to drive and also gas prices so it was a tough thing
15	94	But it took me 2 days of driving this car and I love it, not quite the pickup the mustang had but who cares
15	95	The steering that people are complaining about is touchy but you do get used to it, no biggie to me
15	96	I love the look both inside and out (Black pearl)
15	97	MPG avg is 41 mostly highway but a little mix
16	98	I thought Honda was supposed to be one of the best..
16	99	well what happened? Do they not check out everything before they sell them? 1st time I turned on the A/C I got a horrible smell - then fog (not condensation) of course the service dept didn't believe me when I called, but oh wow, now they do because it is sitting in their shop
16	100	They have no idea what's wrong
17	101	I just purchased the 2.4 2009 vibe with manual trans
17	102	I offered $200 less than the TMV and they accepted my first offer to my surprise
17	103	Great car and if you want to buy one, offer a ridiculously low amount to start with
17	104	They are practically giving these away with all the incentives
17	105	I wanted the 1.8L, but couldn't find one
17	106	The 2.4 is more than enough power, but I still get over 30 MPG with 50/50 driving, so I'm very happy
17	107	Manual is fun to drive and very comfortable
17	108	Cargo space is great, as I can fit my bike in the back without taking any wheels off
17	109	Sound system is great
17	110	I switched from a huge suburban to this and I don't regret it
17	111	Cash for clunkers program is a great deal.
18	112	Got the LS (w/auto) under cash for clunkers
18	113	Outstanding car, especially at the price paid
18	114	Ride, handling, features all excellent
18	115	Lot's of fun to drive, and nearly as versatile as a minivan
18	116	Seems to be very well built
18	117	Base model plus auto and roof rack has everything I need
18	118	I drive in heavy stop and go traffic daily, but have improved my gas mileage by more than a third
18	119	My only complaint- the basic stereo! Has all the features you might want, but sounds like a 1960's pocket transistor radio
18	120	Spring for the upgrade if you can
19	121	I have 2009 that has been in the shop three times under 6000 miles,once for a failure of the tire pressure sensor, twice for IMA battery failures
19	122	The car is currently experiencing the same type of behavior as before the last IMA failures
19	123	Honda states they are having battery problems
19	124	In addition, Honda customer service states the MPG is actually normal for winter driving for Missouri
19	125	Dealer failed to inform us of this when we purchased vehicle
19	126	I find this to be an unethical deceptive practice by Honda
19	127	Car is not the quality we expected from Honda.
20	128	Love the car, hate the wind noise on both the passenger side- whistle and the driver side continual
20	129	Also problems with the windshield wipers
20	130	Have had it to Dealership to resolve the wind noise problem(s) and is still not resolved to my satisfaction
20	131	We like the car I don't like the excessive wind noise
20	132	If I has noticed this in my test drive would not have purchased this vehicle- unfortunate because other than that it seems to be a great car.
21	133	Bought a 2005 AWD Limited and turned 100,000 miles on it
21	134	New car deals are so good now that we traded it in for the 2009, and the new version is so much better! Better looking, smoother driving, and the perks are all very cool
21	135	"Have a hard time understanding how Edmunds calls this SUV ""adequate"" but owners have rated it much closer to the truth"
21	136	Went to FWD and 4 cyl this time and getting 27 mpg on the road
21	137	We have a 6 year old black lab so we get the dark interior and we love the way the rear seats fold flush to the back of the front seats - Max loves to lay with his head on the headrest between us so many other fold-down rear seats just didn't work for us
21	138	The best little SUV made! 
22	139	This is my 3rd maxima and the best
22	140	My first one was a 95 and loved it, second one was a 2000, disappointing
22	141	I walked away from maxima since lost its personality
22	142	After driving other nissans like, 350Z, murano and altima coupe now I'm back to maxima again and could not be happier
22	143	I love everything about this car...well just about everything, accept I wish it was rear wheel drive just like the infiniti G37
22	144	Maybe we'll get there in a few years
23	145	Just got the 2009 Acura TL/AWD/Tech today
23	146	Wow, what a great car this is
23	147	The handling was superb and the drive is fun and comfortable
23	148	I love the Technology Package and especially the voice recognition system
24	149	I test drove 7 autos in this category and nothing came close to the comfort or the ride quality or the PRICE
24	150	We have the Limited V6 with everything but GPS
24	151	I kept reading reviews that the handling was all that great, our other car is a Avalon and I fail to see the difference
24	152	I researched this car for three years while comparing it to others and price/feature wise nothing comes close
24	153	Large trunk and well shaped with fold down rear seats, some have a pass thru.
25	154	1800 miles so far
25	155	Fun to drive
25	156	Feels like a sports car
25	157	Great for utility
25	158	Only slightly smaller in back than my 4runner
25	159	2.4L engine is great but reduces mpg
25	160	I get 30 highway
25	161	35 would be more to my liking
25	162	It's worth it to me so far though
25	163	5-speed manual is fun but needs one more gear on the high end
25	164	A 6th speed (extra overdrive) is what it really needs
25	165	That would gain a few mpg and reduce revs on highway
25	166	This engine could handle it
25	167	Gas pedal seems to be on wrong angle for me (6' and slim)
25	168	Right foot hurts if I drive highway too long
25	169	Always get a nice greeting when people see it, esp younger
25	170	It is a slick looking car
25	171	Clutch was jumpy for first 1000 miles, ok now.
26	172	My F150 has 16,500 miles now
26	173	I can't say enough good words for it
26	174	I just want to say: everyone must have this truck! This truck has a 18-19 combined MPG so far
26	175	It can do everything what a sedan or SUV does
26	176	It seats 6 people
26	177	more room
26	178	more comfortable
26	179	It can do many things a sedan, SUV, mini-van can't do
26	180	You understand what I meant
26	181	I go hunting, fishing
26	182	I help people move their heavy, large stuff
26	183	I buy stuff for my house and garden
26	184	etc
26	185	Everyone must buy a F150
26	186	Only F150!
27	187	I just recently traded my 2002 T&C for a new '09 Touring edition
27	188	I first test drove a used Mercedes E-class because we already own a Mercedes SUV which my husband loves and of course was pleased with the ride but when I asked the question whether our six member family was ready to have my husband's SUV be the largest vehicle in our household, answer came back a resounding NO
27	189	Because have had such great experience with two previous T&C's (trade-in had 130,000+ miles) decided to check out new T&C and dealer incentives
27	190	By the time all the incentives were added (including $3,500 for trade-in) my $37,000 minivan went down to $28,000 and well...the rest is history in the making!
28	191	After my research & comparison on Toyota Yaris & Honda fit, I decided to get Yaris because it wins in most category & fit my needs for daily use
28	192	For two fill-ups, I got 41 MPG ( 40% city/ 60% highway) by driving it gently
28	193	It's amazing & almost as good as a Prius
28	194	The finish is excellent & the dashboard & charcoal fabric are nicer than others
28	195	The ride is smooth & relatively quiet
28	196	It accommodates 4 adults comfortably
28	197	The power & acceleration is outstanding for this small 1.5L engine
28	198	There is nothing to dislike.The only thing I don't like is that the power door lock/keyless entry is not standard
29	199	I just got my Murano a few days ago, the car is extremely great!! Modern looks, luxury interior, great mileage for an SUV
29	200	I compared the Infiniti EX35, FX45, Lexus RX350 and Murano, after all my research, test drives, etc
29	201	I ended up getting the Nissan Murano, sporty look, great tech features, great mileage
29	202	So far totally in love with the car
29	203	Thanks.
30	204	After our third came around it was time to move up in terms of size with our vehicles
30	205	This is our second Honda product so no real surprises in build/material quality, which as been good so far
30	206	The van has been very functional and the power doors are great
30	207	The space within the van is excellent, as is the driving characteristics of the vehicle
30	208	Gas mileage is been in the middle 20's so far, but I will expect less during the winter
30	209	The children love the van and taking long trips has been a much more pleasant experience for the whole family.
31	210	Just picked up the ML for my wife
31	211	We looked at the X5, Q7 and the MDX
31	212	The ML interior is great compared to the others
31	213	The ride is fantastic! I believe that whatever issues this car had previously-they have corrected
31	214	My wife is in heaven
31	215	She loves the seats and says they are the most comfortable she has ever had
31	216	The ride is very quiet and the handling is smooth
31	217	We are very happy with our choice.
32	218	The car rides great, pretty stiff suspension that handles bumps very well, and its very responsive and tight
32	219	It was mainly Sync that got my attention when it came to finding a new car
32	220	I do come from a family that has owned quite a lot of fords, because they made pretty decent cars
32	221	Take the build quality up a bit, and you get a new Ford
32	222	The car feels like its built very well
32	223	With only a 140hp engine, it does struggle to get up most hills
32	224	paired up with the 4 speed auto and no torque, driving on hilly roads isn't pleasant
32	225	I've only put 2500 miles on my car so far, but it seems to be pretty great.
33	226	I carefully considered the Honda and Toyota Hybrids
33	227	Personally the style of the available brands next to the Altima was no comparison, with the Altime clearly the winner in style, speed, great gas mileage, price, space and features
33	228	Altima appearance to me is far superior inside and out
33	229	I moved from a Camry due to a total loss accident to the Altima Hybrid for all of the reasons I just mentioned and the superior crash ratings the Altima has
33	230	Drive everything else first, then get into an Altima
33	231	If you like features, speed, a comparable price and style that turns heads everywhere you go, the Altima Hybrid is the clear winner
33	232	"The tax credit and being ""green"" is a winner in any city."
34	233	I love my Rogue so much
34	234	I waited for a year until my lease was up to get this vehicle
34	235	It is my first SUV and I could not be happier
34	236	I got all the features that I wanted from the Wicked Black paint to the Leather seats and AWD
34	237	It makes me happy every time I get into it and take off down the road.
35	238	As an owner of a 1998 Nissan Maxima, I eagerly awaited the release of the re-designed 2009 Maxima
35	239	I purchased the SV with Premium & Technology packages
35	240	"The car handles very well and rides comfortably in spite of the 18"" tires"
35	241	The interior is inviting but has a mix of quality and inferior looking items
35	242	The plastic wood trim is somewhat of an eyesore and seems to detract from the numerous plush features
35	243	However, all of the other interior details make up for this shortcoming
35	244	The engine is very responsive and the CVT is seamless
35	245	You can't even feel the car shift!
36	246	At first glance it looks like a lot for the money but on closer inspection the interior is cheaply constructed, you cannot transfer the phone book from your cell phone and the seats have no real lateral support
36	247	But all of this pales in the face of the terrible suspension
36	248	The ride is rough and jittery with a tendency towards porpoising on almost all surfaces, even those that appear to be smooth and or recently paved
36	249	I would test drive the heck out of a potential purchase and if you experience the slightest bit of what I have described, pass on it and look at something else
36	250	No other car that I have driven in recent years, of any price point, has these awful ride characteristics
37	251	This is a stylish comfortable Camry wagon
37	252	No pretenses of a rear seat (hello cramped RAV4 third row) and no pretending to be an SUV or crossover or whatever you try to call it other than a station wagon
37	253	Yeah they try to call this a crossover too, but we all really know it is a Camry wagon
37	254	The lines are classy, the interior is well designed and uses quality materials, and the totally predictable handling and bulletproof reliability are great for those who don't like any surprises
37	255	Venza gets you from point A to point B with comfort, good-looks and a minimum of fuss or effort.
38	256	I previously owned a 2003 Mercury Sable
38	257	Traded it in for the 2009 Focus because the Sable had too many miles and I wanted something that got better gas mileage
38	258	I am impressed
38	259	It has more get-up-and-go than the Sable, rides every bit as well (actually quieter) and has every bit as much trunk space
38	260	Not to mention that it is more fun to drive
38	261	The Sync system is nice to have, it is good to have that connectivity in a car
38	262	Ford was forward thinking in putting this on their cars
38	263	All in all, I do not regret the trade at all
38	264	To begin with I was worried that the Focus might seem a lot smaller than the Sable
38	265	We didn't loose much.
39	266	Bought truck October 06 2009 notice ripples around fender walls.Took back to dealership
39	267	Would not do anything said it was GM'S fault called them up and they would not do anything also.Just want to let you chevy truck guys or gals know to check out around fender walls for ripples before you buy.
40	268	My review is just that, mine
40	269	I have owned several cars in my life from Mercedes to Chevy
40	270	I am unhappy with this Honda product
40	271	My wife's 1992 Accord was a better car
40	272	Period.
41	273	I love this car, and it has been great
41	274	At 1200 miles it feels like a dream to drive..
41	275	no issues
41	276	I get plenty of compliments and makes me feel happy to drive it
41	277	The engine has good giddy up in the low-speed range
41	278	Once you're higher up, engine feels like it struggles to move up, nevertheless it's fast enough for me unless you're looking for a speeding ticket.
42	279	Most people won't care about this, but there is a design flaw in the Flex
42	280	I ordered one and felt the vehicle was ideal for me in most ways
42	281	I'm very tall and the headroom and legroom are exceptional
42	282	"Which is great, except for the fact that a tall person (I'm 6'7"") cannot comfortably drive this vehicle! Because it lacks a telescoping steering column, even my long arms are at full extension with no bend at the elbows"
42	283	This became uncomfortable even during a short drive; during a long trip it would be unbearable.
43	284	Style is obviously good
43	285	But the interior (radio and environmental) is not that impressive
43	286	The fan comes on full speed with a twist of the temp control and other buttons/knobs..
43	287	I find it pretty annoying
43	288	The leather seems pretty cheesy
43	289	If you put something lightly heavy on the seats it show an indentation forever
43	290	I have the std
43	291	Speaker system installed
43	292	The sound quality is not horrible, but its pretty bad
43	293	The speedo is also off by one mph
43	294	At night the interior lights do night dime enough
43	295	It gets pretty bright once your eyes adjust to dark.
44	296	We did a lot of research on the Venza before buying it
44	297	The Pros far out weigh the Cons
44	298	We have owned a Ford Edge, which drives like a truck
44	299	The Venza drives like a luxury car
44	300	We drove both the 4 cyl and the 6 cyl Venza
44	301	The 6 cyl has better performance and had a better response time
44	302	The engine on the 6 cy is a lot quieter than the 4 cyl
44	303	We ordered our Aloe Green model with leather and without the Nav
44	304	Our Garman does the trick, we can take it with us when leave the car, and we can update the GPS on our computer.
45	305	We traded in our 04 Chrysler Town and Country that had 170,000 (my husband drives a lot for work)for the CR V
45	306	What a great and fun to drive truck it is! Our other car is a Volvo XC90, and while I enjoy driving it, the CR V is so easy to maneuver and park that I have virtually kidnapped th CR V from my husband
45	307	It really is a great value compact SUV for the money, not to mention the Honda reliability
45	308	This is our 3rd Honda and we couldn't be more pleased.
46	309	Buying a 2009 Accord has been the worst purchase I've made in the last 20 years
46	310	Several days after bringing the car home, I started hearing a loud wind noise through the drivers side door when you drove at freeway speeds
46	311	After 5 trips to the dealership and having it be in the shop for 2 weeks, I was essentially told, I'd just have to deal with the noise
46	312	Wonderful! Then at 2000 miles the brakes have started to make a grinding noise, oh and I've noticed a vibrating sound coming from the dash (which I hit with my hand to stop), not to mention the loud clicking the CD player makes
46	313	Essentially this car is a mess, save yourself some money and go buy a Geo Metro.
47	314	This is a great car
47	315	It exhibits the critical balance between performance, style and comfort, while maintaining a true sports car feel
47	316	This car invites you to drive it - it is so much at home on a winding road with the top down - it delivers just what the car was designed to do - a oneness with the road and a fun factor that is off scale
47	317	The 6 speed transmission is a joy, the audio system sounds great, the top up / down operation is effortless and the car has great visual appeal
47	318	Test drive one - you will love it!
48	319	I'm 48
48	320	After many years of sports cars and pick-ups, including my last Chevy S-10,which literally fell apart at 70,000 miles, I bought a new Sonata
48	321	I am a family man, with daughters 11 and 8
48	322	My wife drives a van
48	323	So, I decided to be practical -- buy a family sedan with good ratings and few frills
48	324	It came down to a Sonata or Honda Accord
48	325	I liked the Sonata better after test drives (the base Accord had a weird dash with giant radio call numbers) -- and it was $3,600 less
48	326	So far I like it, though there may be a 'thump' underneath
48	327	I liked the S-10 new too for a while, but quickly problems arose and I was profoundly disappointed overall
48	328	No more union- made cars for me.
49	329	After owning BMW's and Mercedes (2 lemons in a row), this is my 1st Audi
49	330	It is awesome! Very comfortable, wonderful variable steering, great electronics
49	331	"I am impressed by the 4 cylinder turbo; quick acceleration, especially when down shift to the ""S"" mode (passed 5 cars on 2 lane country road-WOW!)"
49	332	We take it on the Interstate every weekend while our BMW 330 sits in the garage
49	333	Gas mileage is 24 around town and 27-30 on highway, depending on how I drive
49	334	The 2009 A-4 surpasses my expectations
50	335	My wife and I enjoy driving this car
50	336	It is comfortable, has good power and good looks
50	337	We hve been totally satisfied
50	338	Compared to an import it was much less expensive
50	339	We think the AMERICAN CARS GET A BAD RAP FROM REVIEWERS.
51	340	 With just over 2200 miles, I'm noticing the MPG going up.
51	341	average has gone from 31 to 35
51	342	Acceleration is a real kick, and with the windows now tinted black, this little white coupe looks even sharper
51	343	A/C works like a champ, and cools the car in about a minute with fan speed initially set at 3
51	344	From there it drops to 1, or it's too cold.
51	345	and we're talking So
51	346	Ariz
51	347	The engine runs cool.
51	348	about 195 in the heat of the day
51	349	The ride is great, and was complimented by a friend who drives a Volvo
51	350	I love this car, and as an old motor head, I rate it right at the top with some of my past hot rods and trucks, even my Sentra
51	351	Killer mileage, and it doesn't get hot
51	352	What a relief
52	353	Do not buy the PAX model
52	354	The tires only last 25,000 miles, if that, and they cost $1,500 for a set of four
52	355	This means, that by the time you hit 50,000 miles (when most tires wear out), you will have spent $4,500 on tires
52	356	If you get a flat, Honda recommends you buy 2 new tires because the tires are not repairable
52	357	Nice going Honda...
53	358	This is the best car we have owned
53	359	Drives great, looks great
53	360	Gave it to my wife as a birthday present
53	361	She loves the blue color and the numerous features the car has
53	362	We have taken it on two trips and it has done great
53	363	People stare at it when we stop at lights and restaurants
53	364	VW has done a great job on this one
53	365	This is our third VW
53	366	Happy Driving!!
54	367	Test drove the Challenger and had to own it
54	368	It's a head turner for sure
54	369	The Hemi-Orange is a real standout and gets attention
54	370	Acceleration is impressive be it gradual on surface streets after upshift, or stomping it on the freeway entrance
54	371	Slower than the old 426, but does get up and run
54	372	Excellent handling a joy to drive
54	373	Moderate pavement noise
54	374	Hope it doesn't get worse
54	375	This not a young persons car
54	376	First time in my life a vette picked a fight, they NEVER do that
54	377	I didn't even try, I knew better, and street racing is bad news period
54	378	This car is all about the look, feel, and pride of owning one
54	379	Glad Chrysler brought it back
54	380	Now if they would just retro the Charger....
55	381	I loved my old Legacy way (97)
55	382	The new 09 Forester is a perfect size for my small family
55	383	Excellent Visibily, handly, performance, brakes, suspension that dampens road bump, quite cabin with well insultated dooe frames, Versatility (family car on pavement, country car on dirt roads nice clearance
55	384	Simple yet functional ergonomics, good power on base.
56	385	My XM radio is not receiving a signal, the malibu is in the shop for three days to fix - I have 1200 miles on the car, not happy
56	386	The lastest is they may have to replace radio - more time in the shop
56	387	The four cylinder, six speed automatic transmission is great
56	388	I like the car - even with the radio issue
56	389	Hard to believe but I would strongly recommend this Chevy to all
56	390	I test drove many cars - this car is as good, I believe better than: Honda, Nissan, Toyota, Mazda and etc
56	391	I wanted to buy American and thought I might have to accept less - the Malibu is a great car - really
56	392	The gas mileage is excellent for the car's size and weight
56	393	All will like the mpg - very quiet
56	394	GM lives!
57	395	I was debating between the 2008 Lexus ES350 and this Acura
57	396	I am so happy that I have made the perfect choice to bring it home
57	397	I love it
57	398	The driving is very smooth and powerful
57	399	I am driving a lot everyday, the MPG is around 28 on freeway
57	400	The seats are very comfortable
57	401	I love the design inside out
57	402	I did not purchase the tech
57	403	package, but came with the car are the bluetooth, iphone connection features
58	404	I traded my 2006 Accord Sedan, for the 2009 Accord Coupe
58	405	I'm really happy with my trade
58	406	The body style is sleek and sharp
58	407	Although the EX has 190 HP, I think it drives fast and smooth
58	408	I'm having lots of fun driving this baby around
58	409	Although there's lots more buttons on the console, I found it easy to navigate
58	410	A lot of people complain about the road noise, but I have no problem with it, and I ain't going deaf.
59	411	I recently switched from an 05 F150 King Ranch to the 09 Ram 1500 Laramie and haven't looked back
59	412	Dodge has hit a home run with this truck
59	413	I get remarks from people daily saying how nice a truck it is
59	414	The styling, comfort and performance are all impressive
59	415	The rear seat entertainment system is really cool too
59	416	My kid can enjoy the cartoon network 24/7 now
59	417	"The only nitpick I have is the plastic chrome covers over the 20"" aluminum spoked wheels"
59	418	Shame on you Dodge.
60	419	It's an otherwise GREAT car but have had a dead battery 2-times!!! Serviced at Steinle GM in Fremont, OH but they can't fix it either because they dont care or dont know how
60	420	It has run down protection so the battery should never go dead
60	421	"They just say ""there's nothing we can do""."
61	422	we went to the dealership just to rule out the Challenger, because we had every intention of getting the Camaro but I was very impressed and when I did finally see the Camaro, there was no doubt in our minds that the Challenger was it
61	423	This car rocks, orange w/black stripes,20inch wheels,manual,sunroof,leather seat,the looks everytime we go out, honks,stares,waves,thumbs up from people I have never met
61	424	My wife drove it home while I was at work, when I started it for the first time in my garage, I giggled like a little school girl when I heard the sound of the exhaust
61	425	We first tried to order a V6 and the deal fell through, I'm so thankful it did, the 5.7 V8 Hemi is awesome.
62	426	Great family ride
62	427	Have 2 kids who play a lot of sports, and taking them and their friend to games has been a breeze
62	428	Have had 8 people in the Pilot including 6 10 year old boys and everyone fits with plenty of room
62	429	Even when I have fewer kids, the kids will elect to sit in the third row
62	430	Just goes to show you how much space it has.
63	431	Replaced a horrible GMC Safari with the Honda Pilot
63	432	Should have done it sooner
63	433	Took pilot on a 500 mile trip to Myrtle Beach and got 22+ MPG during break in
63	434	Fit, finish, reliability on ours has been perfect (1500 miles so far)
63	435	Rides quiet and smooth--sometimes I think it has shut off sitting at a light
63	436	Mileage is as advertised, although the mileage readout feature on dash can teach you to be light-footed and bump the mileage up some (AWD gets close to 16 in stop and go commute and close to 23 mpg on I-95 with its occasional slowdowns)
63	437	Turning radius makes it easy to handle
63	438	Seating comfort and room is 100% better in 2009 than 2008.
64	439	The new Ram is an exciting new vehicle in the Dodge lineup
64	440	The design is aggressive the interior is beautiful the motor is solid and it's incredibly quiet on the highway
64	441	The rear 4 link suspension makes this truck ride so smooth it feels like a luxury vehicle
64	442	The wrap around console keeps everything within reach and everything is where you expect it to be
64	443	The nighttime display is very nice
64	444	Hands down I drove an F-150 and a Silverado and this was the smoothest and best looking truck of them all
64	445	Also the price was the cheapest of all of them! You can't go wrong with the new 2009 Ram
65	446	We purchased a 2009 Toyota Corolla LE May 31, 2008
65	447	At about 2000 miles the VSC Light came on flashing
65	448	Took it back to dealer and they could not find anything wrong
65	449	The light came back on and it started to spit and sputter and die for no reason around 3000 miles
65	450	Took it back to dealer and they replaced the Mass Air Flow Sensor and cleared the codes again
65	451	Was driving it again and slowed down to turn a corner and it died for no reason
65	452	It currently has 4500 miles on it and the dealer has had it for a week
65	453	They called and said they are ordering a new wiring harness which is supposed to fix the problem
65	454	I'm now wondering what will be next.
66	455	When we first got the Lancer in mild weather it was fantastic - we felt like we were driving a luxury car! We first noticed an issue with the radio/speakers a few months ago
66	456	The radio didn't actually start to make noise until the dial was at 15
66	457	Last week, anytime anything other than talk radio the speakers are now crackling
66	458	Since winter started the rear door windows are taking FOREVER to defrost (over an hour) and interior parts are rattling (locks on the doors, back window, silver stripe on the passenger door)
66	459	We called the dealership and they told us there was nothing they could do about the rattling or the defrost issues as when it gets cold that's what happens
66	460	Nice response! 
67	461	Absolutely love this car! Like most, I thought luxury came in the form a German automobile
67	462	This car changes all notions
67	463	Never considered a car from GM before, however, I am absolutely thrilled with this purchase.
68	464	This is one of the most fun cars to drive
68	465	It's fast, like 140mph on a two lane parkway fast, yet it rides like a luxury car.
69	466	This is my first car in 10 years
69	467	I drove a Grand Cherokee Lorado
69	468	Since I drive 90 plus miles round trip to work a day, my husband and I decided with gas pricing soaring we need a vehicle with better gas mileage, but for a low price with high performance and the Hyundai Sonata meets all our needs
69	469	I had my mind made on Powder White Pearl with Coco(charcoal gray) interior and a 4 cyl
69	470	however this was a color combination that was next to impossible to find
69	471	I decided to go with Medium silver blue with gray leather interior
69	472	I love it
69	473	We have put 1299 miles on our Sonata since May 31, 2008
69	474	No problems so far
69	475	I enjoy driving it.
70	476	Gave in to the wife's wishes to go for the quirky styling and better gas mileage
70	477	It sure gets it's share of thumbs-ups and curious looks, which is good because we have sign graphics for our business on the back window
70	478	Unexpected 30.5mpg mileage for her daily 140-mile roundtrip to a new office, 50% better mileage than our Pathfinder
70	479	This alone will save us $200 a month
70	480	I like a lot of features, esp
70	481	with the SL package, and some I don't like, see below.
71	482	I recently purchased a TDI Sportwagen with the panorama sunroof and 6-speed manual
71	483	I have driven the car about 500 miles
71	484	I have averaged 39 MPG and have gotten up to 46 on longer highway trips
71	485	The size is perfect, roomy back seat and plenty of cargo space
71	486	The huge sunroof really brightens up the black interior
71	487	The car is plenty peppy and a lot of fun to drive
71	488	Overall I am very satisfied so far.
72	489	This is the best Caravan yet and we have 7 in the extended family
72	490	The only thing that would be nice is if the drivers seat would lower all the way to the floor
72	491	very nice workmanship and a very tight vehicle
72	492	I am a mechanic and drove several of these before buying the 4.0
72	493	My daughter did too so get one while you can folks.
73	494	I got this car to knock around and get to work instead of driving my gas gulping 07 4runner
73	495	I am really impressed on how it rides and the styling of the corolla
73	496	I have the regular model and it has all of the features that the other models do except it does not have power windows
73	497	The engine is strong for a 1.8 liter and has ample pull with a smooth transmission
73	498	I love the color I got; its called Capri sea metallic which is a nice light green metallic and I have beige interior
73	499	The gas mileage is excellent
73	500	I'm averaging 38 mpg
74	501	Just bought my Honda Fit Sport-it was love at first sight
74	502	Great car, Honda has at least a 9+, in this one
74	503	Interstate driving is a breeze, When I started looking I was gong to check out the Toyota Yaris, but stopped by the Honda dealer first, and that is as far as I got
74	504	It rides great, is sporty looking, and has great fuel mileage and it's not even broke in yet
75	505	I had my Accord for 13 months total, put over 20k miles on it
75	506	I could not stand the uncomfortable seats any longer
75	507	The headrests bothered me because they would push my head forward no matter which height they were at and the seats were rather hard and the lumbar support did not provide much satisfaction
75	508	Honda Customer Service told me that they cannot do anything for me at this time as the seats and headrest are designed to safety regulations and if they have a recall, they would let me know
75	509	Last week, I traded it in for a well equipped 2009 S80, which stickered for $42k and I bought it for $32k
75	510	The seats are much more comfortable and I no longer have back pain when driving.
76	511	Sadly, this is our last Accord for a while
76	512	We have had all the brake issues described before
76	513	Ours was fixed under warranty 5 times and now we are told we are on our own by Honda
76	514	The service bulletin everyone is waiting on is not coming
76	515	The '10's will be out next month, so 2 years and no fix is just that
76	516	No fix
76	517	The cycling of the exterior lights is just annoying
76	518	Its much worse than Hondas past that only did it when the compressor kicked in and was not that noticeable
76	519	And yes we were very disappointed in the seat comfort of the EXL model compared to years past
76	520	Traded it for a Venza at 45k, sadly we are done with Honda, the quality and customer service is just not there anymore
77	521	I have just completed my first 3 months of owning a BMW
77	522	The performance of the car on the road is as advertised
77	523	Stupidly fast!! Steering a little tight in the parking lot, but exceptional as you get going
77	524	I absolutely love the sound of the twin turbo charged engine, and the effortless ease at which the car accelerates
77	525	My only major gripe with the car is the interior
77	526	Whilst the quality of the material is ok, it's way too plain and dull for a $50,000 sports sedan
77	527	I think it is the worst interior off all the cars competing in this segment
77	528	The interior of the Audi, Benz, Lexus, and Cadillac is a lot better
77	529	BMW, take note!
78	530	"We love this car! We test drove the Flex and that was all it took to say ""we'll buy it!"" Our last car was a Toyota Avalon, but the Flex simply is a better ride"
78	531	My wife and I are getting older so we wanted comfort, which the Flex excels at for both short trips around town and long trips when we visit our grandchildren 300 miles away
78	532	We use the built in Travel Link to check Live Weather Radar, Gas station prices and local movie listings! Cool! So many people have stopped us to ask about the Flex and told us they love the look! Even the 20 something bank teller at the drive through this week
78	533	Definitely a head turner with the white roof! Our friends all want to drive our car!
79	534	I've had no problems with the engine, but everything inside this car rattles...the dash, the door panel....and it drives you insane!! Poor, poor fit and finish
79	535	Sounds like loose change is inside the door
79	536	"Took to dealer and of course they drove it on a smooth road and ""couldn't reproduce"""
79	537	Also when steering wheel is in upper position, can't see the odometer
79	538	Automatic locking everything also drives you insane when getting groceries etc
79	539	out of the trunk and back seat...the doors keep locking (found a way to disable the rear door auto-lock, but the trunk eludes me
79	540	When you close trunk, doors automatically lock...then you have to unlock them again!
80	541	I purchased a 2009 VW Rabbit, after looking at other cars in its class, including the Mitsubish Lancer GTS, Mazda 3, and Subaru Impreza
80	542	While I think I could have been happy with any of the other cars mentioned, I truly love my Rabbit
80	543	I could not justify the additional price of the GTI for a few fractions of a second faster from 0-60 mph, and the added costs for premium fuel and insurance
80	544	The Rabbit will satisfy all but the most power hungry
80	545	Fuel economy is mediocre, but a fair trade off for power and performance
80	546	The Rabbit has the best build quality, not just in intelligent design, but in the material used
80	547	It does not feel like a sub $20,000 car, nor does it drive like one.
81	548	This truck replaced a 2008 Volvo XC90
81	549	I never thought I would love a truck as much as the Volvo
81	550	I was very wrong
81	551	The Pilot has a very smooth ride and great pickup for its size
81	552	The interior is roomy enough for several kids and all of their gear
81	553	Road noise seems less than in older models
81	554	Gas mileage is not great - 16 mpg on average, but it's mostly city driving
81	555	I have black interior/exterior and it's really classy looking
81	556	Was mistaken for the big Mercedes SUV the other day! 
82	557	Needed a vehicle that would be comfortable/functional and modestly priced
82	558	I'm always on the road for both business and pleasure(16K since buying mine Sept 08)
82	559	I work hard, play harder and often haul gear, a minimum of two additional passengers their skis, snow boards, camping equipment, golf clubs...the list goes on! My Journey has handled it all with ease
82	560	Just returned from a 5 hour road trip and my passengers all raved about how comfortable it was...even compared it to my friends BMW X5 but with more space and a far lower price tag! Did have one BIG problem with breaking system and after 4th visit it was fixed
82	561	My dealer rocks and treated me right so overall I am very pleased.
83	562	I was online as soon as I saw the first TV commercial for the Flex
83	563	Finally, they brought back the Luxury Wagon! This is not a mini-van
83	564	The owner reviews at Edmunds.com regarding the comfort, quiet, details etc
83	565	inspired a test drive and purchase
83	566	This is a wonderfully comfortable car! It is a luxury sedan with room in the back! It handles smoothly
83	567	I am impressed with everything Ford included in this package
83	568	For the past year, I had been feeling forced to look at different makes, models and styles that I didn't LOVE because it was time for a new car
83	569	So glad I held out
83	570	Love My Flex! 
84	571	I want everyone to rethink Ford as their cars and trucks are just as reliable as their Japanese counterparts
84	572	I bought this to replace my 2004 Escape V6
84	573	I have to admit that the 2.5L has just as much pep as the V6 did in the 2004
84	574	The fit and finish is night and day between the two
84	575	I looked at all of the competitors and found this one to be much better in style, interior comfort and fuel economy
84	576	I read all of the reviews and did not understand why a lot of reviews claim poor quality and outdated design
84	577	Have you looked at the RAV4 lately
84	578	Interior and exterior are so ugly
84	579	I want my SUV to look like one otherwise I would have gotten a car.
85	580	I have owned many Dodge trucks -- '91, '95, '96, '99, '02, '04, '07 and '09
85	581	The '09 is by far the best
85	582	Build quality is unparalleled
85	583	Have traveled in many Chev
85	584	and Fords, the new Dodge is far superior
85	585	Took this new truck on a 1,200 mile trip first weekend I owned it, horrible winter roads -- truck stayed completely composed even at high speeds on wet and icy road
85	586	Totally amazed at the ride, power, composure and competence of this truck
85	587	Great creature comforts and interior amenities
85	588	Much more comfortable truck than previos models
85	589	I look forward to many happy miles in this truck
85	590	I use it for business and travel long distances
85	591	Can't say enough about how impressed I am.
86	592	The greatest car I ever owned in terms of practicality and fun to drive
86	593	This vehicle was purchased under the program of car for clunkers by trading '95 Lexus sc400
86	594	Since the adoption of the car, I have been stunned every day by 1.8 liter engine's peppy performance on free way
86	595	I couldn't figure out how the small engine has the great power, compared to my previous 8 cylinder coupe
86	596	Last week, my four family took Cube to LasVegas trip rather than on my wife's mini van
86	597	All felt great through overnight round-trip because it has roomy and cushy seats with pretty good speakers
86	598	So, Every morning is pleasure itself.
87	599	Love this truck! I ordered the regular cab short bed 5.7L Hemi 4x4 Sport
87	600	I've owned Chevy's and Fords, but never a Dodge
87	601	Did a lot of research before this purchase
87	602	For the first time in a long time, it's fun driving to and from work
87	603	This is a hot rod that can work as well
87	604	It corners, accelerates, hauls, and pulls a landscape trailer like it isn't even there
87	605	As others have said, the ride is phenomenal
87	606	Plenty of interior storage space, even though it's a regular cab
87	607	Did I mention I love this truck?
88	608	Coming from a Ford family is was hard to purchase a car from across the pond but I am glad I did
88	609	My last two cars were ZX2s and did a great job getting me though college and graduate school but moving to the CC is a whole new story! This car is just so tight and responsive compared to any Ford I have ever driven including the Mustang
88	610	This car is even nicer than my fathers LS and my wife?s MB
88	611	Only thing I would do different is get the car in Black and get the Nav
88	612	Not sure why some people post that they are getting bad gas mileage? I do a lot of highway driving and average 27-30MPG (probably due to the six speed).
89	613	Choose out of Vibe, Mazda3 5D, and another pickup
89	614	Very pleased with the car so far, the fuel economy is slightly disappointing for a small 4cyl car, but is passable after driving a pickup for 10 years
89	615	Handles great, comfortable on long drives, and have no major issues with the car so far.
90	616	"I just got my new XD with the ""Cash for Clunkers"" program"
90	617	They gave me $4500 for my 16-year old minivan with 165,000 miles on it
90	618	Love it so far
90	619	So fun to drive! My dog (Lab) does miss all the room in her van, but the back seats can be easily laid flat, and she'll have plenty of room in the new car.
91	620	I was leaving my 2007 9-3 Saab, looking for something with more rear room, bigger trunk and a little more tech features
91	621	Looked at the Infiniti G37xS sedan, which was everything I wanted, except that I really wasn't in love with its exterior looks, and the rear seat was not that much roomier than my Saab
91	622	I also looked at the Hyundai Genesis, which was very interesting, but I just wasn't a fan of the center console, the pricing I was getting and the fact that I would be telling people I had a Hyundai for $500 a month
91	623	Maxima ended up being the best balance, although I would have preferred the 7sp and extra horsepower of the G37
92	624	Just leased a TL w/Tech about 4 days ago and all I can say is WOW! I love this car so much, it is powerful, roomy, and has very nice styling
92	625	I get head turns everywhere I go
92	626	I got the WDP/Taupe and I just love it
92	627	The NAV and Bluetooth are so easy to use and the NAV screen is really clear
92	628	This is definitely the best car for the money
92	629	I have owned Acura's before and they did a really good job on this new TL
92	630	I love every minute I'm driving in it.
93	631	Very happy with my Vibe so far except that I notice the interior scratches easily
93	632	I don't have kids or dogs and I am not hard on my cars 
93	633	I haven't even gone camping yet and my interior is all scratched up
93	634	Anyone else have this problem?
94	635	First-time Camry owner with only 4k on the clock
94	636	Combined city/hwy mpg is 30.2 so far
94	637	Very smooth and quiet on the road for an I4, with minimal road/engine noise
94	638	Truly a solid and well-built sedan
94	639	Excellent overall.
95	640	I had followed this car ever since it was revealed in Detriot Show
95	641	The only thing I can say is this is the best car I've ever owned
95	642	I was an advent Nissan car owner, but when I test drove the Genesis, I was sold
95	643	For what you get at the price, you can't beat it
95	644	"A gentleman in a BMW 7- series stopped me in the parking lot to ask me what kind of car is that, I proudly said ""The Genesis"""
96	645	Drives like a car, smooth drive and just fun to drive
96	646	Great buy for your money.
97	647	After 18000 miles I had to have new back breaks put on
97	648	The leather is fading inside already - car is garage kept
97	649	Noise is really is ridiculous
97	650	Got 21k on it now and would trade it in if I could and get something else
97	651	Should have just saved my money and got the 4cylinder instead.
98	652	This is my 5th Corolla
98	653	It does not disappoint
98	654	I average about 34 mpg
98	655	The controls are very easy to operate and make this a very convenient vehicle
98	656	The design of this car is very attractive
98	657	I have received many compliments
98	658	In a world where gas prices are peaking out into outer space, the Corolla is a very good buy.
99	659	Great car
99	660	Handles very well on the road
99	661	Drives and feels very stable, just like the Altima and Maxima
99	662	The car is actually fairly wide, and that makes it feel even more stable
99	663	Takes a bit of time getting used to it, but it is not a disadvantage
99	664	Driver has a lot more visibility on the road thanks to the high seating position inside the car
99	665	The engine is very responsive in all situations
99	666	Breaks are also responsive without being too touchy
99	667	There is plenty of space for a family of 5 inside this vehicle
99	668	This model comes well equipped and avoids including many of the useless bells and whistles other SUVs have
99	669	The standard options are just what is needed without being pretentious.
100	670	We purchased our Rav 4 in Febuary and so far so good
100	671	Typical Toyota quality
100	672	Snow, ice, and now mud doesn't slow this baby down
100	673	Although it's not a hardcore 4X4, it does the job
100	674	I'd buy another one tomorrow.
101	675	I purchased this vehicle 11/08
101	676	I have owned 3 other Nissan vehicles and I have enjoyed driving them
101	677	The 2009 Murano has been a huge disappointment
101	678	I recently took this vehicle on a 6 hour road trip and I was actually in pain when I arrived at my destination
101	679	The driver's seat is rock hard and has very little leg and back support
101	680	If you have leg and back problems, please think twice before purchasing this vehicle.
102	681	This is a jazzed up Honda at best
102	682	By no means does this truck have a true level of luxury, in fact, an Accord V6 may be more luxurious
102	683	That being said, it's all about performance in the RDX, and a fun factor that you will not find in any other smaller SUV
102	684	The RDX is the best driving small SUV out, it's faster, handles better, and has fantastic steering - new editions like the Q5 will give it a run, but its price keep it from being shopped together.
103	685	Owned the car for about a month now
103	686	Overall it is a good experience
103	687	Very smooth ride because of the CVT
103	688	Nice interior and exterior design
103	689	Fuel economy is good
103	690	Average mpg is about 25-27 mpg 60% city/40% highway driving
103	691	The only complaint is the engine noise when you hit the gas
103	692	But that didn't bother me too much
104	693	I just recently purchased a brand new Toyota Camry Hybrid and I am thrilled with the purchase! As a person who has a work commute of 70 miles round trip, I felt the need to consider a hybrid car
104	694	A quiet and smooth ride
104	695	The technology in the car is great
104	696	The dashboard indicators tell you how many miles per gallon you are averaging during the ride
104	697	It also tells you when you are using gas and when you are using battery! It definitely promotes better, safer, and more fuel efficient driving
104	698	When the car is idle, it is DEAD QUIET in the cabin
104	699	There is great pride in ownership
104	700	You are driving a car that gets great gas mileage (33-34 MPG) and helping out the environment
104	701	Aux input for my iPod!
105	702	The Malibu was the perfect choice for me
105	703	Quiet 4cyl., smooth ride,and love the electric steering (seems more precise to me)
105	704	This car is heavier perhaps that explains why it feels more solid than it's competitors
105	705	I prefer the four speed Auto (two less gears to worry about)this car shifts smooth and lack of road noise is delightful
105	706	All new car buyer reviews are generally good I hope I still feel this positive about my choice after 30,000 miles but that would apply to any choice you would make.
106	707	I live in Toronto, Canada
106	708	Canadian market has SE Plus model, same 4.0 L engine except for $1,000 more you get more features (remote keyless entry, sunscreen glass, speed control, roof rack, security alarm)
106	709	I had additional upgrades like Premium seats (same as SXT) for $375 and auto dim rear view mirror plus bluetooth for $300
106	710	Engine is noisy at high rams and lacks power
106	711	Otherwise quiet on highway.
107	712	From a woman point of view I love the car! I like the way it looks
107	713	But my husband has enjoyed it also
107	714	The interior space is surprisingly big; I mean, I knew everybody talks about the cargo space, but as a passenger you do have lots of room to play with
107	715	It has a nice turn to it, it is a smooth drive.
108	716	I have had my car for about a week and am very happy with it
108	717	My first half-tank of diesel has gotten me 350 miles! Beyond that, it's a car with excellent fit-and-finish, great sound, smooth ride, and a classy feel
108	718	It feels like I bought a much more expensive car
108	719	There is plenty of room for four people, and there is ample hip, shoulder, and leg room
108	720	The car is fun to drive, has unbelievable torque and accelerates nicely.
109	721	Have wanted an SUV for a long time but have driven paid for cars for a while
109	722	Decided to make the jump to a new car (and payment) but I don't drive all that much so didn't want to make a huge investment
109	723	The Rogue gives me the SUV for a reasonable payment
109	724	Handling and styling are great, have hauled 12 bags of mulch in the back with the seats down and could have held more
109	725	VERY satisifed overall
109	726	Need to be a bit cautious on lane changes due to blind spots caused by small side windows towards the back - working on mirror adjustments and not changing lanes as much! Engine has a lot of oomph and the ride is really smooth.
110	727	We decided to get rid of our 2002 Chev
110	728	Trailblazer for something smaller and more economical
110	729	As we currently own a 2008 Altima, we decided to try the Murano out for a test drive and we were sold.
111	730	I tested them all
111	731	Replaces LR3 and before that Honda Pilot
111	732	Blows both those cars out of the water in almost every way
111	733	Space, space, space, comfort, drivability, features, practicality, fit and finish, design are all superb
111	734	Never seen a Ford like this before
111	735	Did a couple road trips with the wife and 2 kids and it was amazing for everyone
111	736	Separate seats and huge storage bin in the back for kids
111	737	Bought with separate screens in headrests so each kid could watch a movie of choice or my daughter could plug in laptap in 110V plug or son could plug in Game cube to screen
111	738	Comfortable seats, smooth drive, feeling of safety, great nav/sat radio for the adults
111	739	Outstanding vehicle!
112	740	My trade was a 2006 A3 sport that I had for 2.5 years
112	741	I liked it so much I wanted to see what else Audi had that was just a little bit larger, more comfortable yet just as much fun to drive
112	742	The A4 Avant Sport was it
112	743	Options I got: Premium Plus, Sport, Navigation, Rear Side Airbags
112	744	This car is unbelievable
112	745	The BMW 325xi wagon cost $8k more for the same equipment but had a cheaper interior and didn't drive as well
112	746	The Infiniti EX had sub-par interior quality although it drove great
112	747	However, I'm not going to apologize to my back seat passengers as they trip getting out of the car (small back seat and door opening if I'm buying a $44k car and I would have to do that with the EX).
113	748	The drivers seat is very hard, and hurts the thighs
113	749	The Accord gets fair gas mileage
113	750	The carpet looks cheap I can see the lining of the carpet
113	751	The audio system sound is not very impressive
113	752	At 180 miles my brakes needed to by repaired, warped rotors
113	753	A lot of noise, road as well as rattles
113	754	My previous car was a 03 Honda Accord EX
113	755	Miss that car!
114	756	The seats (EX-L coupe) are simply awful for both me and my passenger
114	757	I get back pain, and my passenger gets neck pain from the head restraint
114	758	None of this was apparent on the test drive
114	759	Takes about 45 mins
114	760	or an hour to kick in
114	761	I have never had this experience in over 35 years of car ownership! Also don't like rear visibility
114	762	Can't see objects in rear quarter, and hard to tell where the rear bumper is in parking
114	763	Finally, low end torque with 190 Hp is still sub-par
114	764	On paper (and test drive) this is a fine car
114	765	Have owned two other Honda's with no problems
114	766	Unfortunately I let that sway my purchase
114	767	Am considering trading in for something else, with only 1100 miles.
115	768	This 09 replaced our 2008 RAV
115	769	It is all it was billed to be
115	770	Love the nimbleness with the v6
115	771	With the addition of the K&N air filter we get 24.8 city and 26 on the highway.
116	772	I love driving this car
116	773	The ride is smooth yet still sporty
116	774	Subaru was clever with some really small stuff, like leaving a space for your ipod cable to exit the armrest storage
116	775	"A simple clip to hold up the rear floor cover which accesses the ""secret space"" under the cargo area"
116	776	I have three dogs and with the 1 of the rear seats down they can move around and get comfortable
116	777	"(I purchased a very cool cargo cover from Canvasback of Idaho which makes clean up after taking the dogs to the lake much easier.) I love the big 17"" tires and two tone exterior"
116	778	I have the Newport Blue Pearl which is only 1 of 2 models with the silver cladding at the bottom
116	779	The sunroof is humongous
117	780	Just purchased my first Honda and first minivan
117	781	It just came off the assembly line two weeks ago and the family could not be more excited
117	782	Having driven sports cars, sedans and wagons up until this point, I can honestly say after a short adjustment to the driving dynamic of a van, it is just wonderful
117	783	Having the unusual ability to detect even the smallest fault, there is a slight rattle/buzz above driver's head area, but the radio easily compensates
117	784	It is a living room on wheels, the kids have plenty of room and love all the options/variations, space
117	785	Insanely comfortable, amazing visibility, plenty of power and a VCM system that is nearly imperceptible
117	786	On the first half tank 19 mpg city.
118	787	This is our 2nd Vibe, the first being an 05, which was a great vehicle
118	788	This one easily surpasses that
118	789	Very smooth and quiet, by comparison with good power
118	790	Fuel mileage has been outstanding
118	791	With the rebates and credit card points available it was a deal we couldn't pass up, even though we weren't in the market for a new car
118	792	However, my wife has already informed me that she will be getting a speeding ticket as this Vibe is much quicker and smoother than her old one
118	793	We're extremely pleased, again
118	794	Can't believe GM won't be offering this vehicle any more
118	795	Major mistake! Please reconsider, GM.
119	796	Bought the Prius May 2009 and love it
119	797	Had one as a rental car for a week and decided then that my next car was going to be a Prius
119	798	Thanks to Toyota's 0% interest, I'm not a liar
119	799	We are averaging about 46 mpg with mostly interstate driving and some city
119	800	I have averaged as high as mid 50's on the interstate while still doing approx 65 mph
119	801	I think my wife just has a heavy foot when she drives
119	802	Traded in a 07 Civic and WOW, the Prius beats the Civic in every category, especially comfort and performance
119	803	I no longer feel like I am driving a college kid's car
119	804	The dealer had aftermarket leather installed on the seats, but gave me a great deal on this car
120	805	I changed my mind a day before to purchase an 09 Accord EXL V6
120	806	I made a great deal on both vehicles
120	807	I only had to pay 1000 more to get a TSX
120	808	The new V6 Accord engine is new in the market with the 3/4/6 cylinder running mode
120	809	Didn't like that
120	810	Didn't know the TSX is in my price range
120	811	TSX was quieter than Accord
120	812	Better suspension, better material (leather), comes with HID, and better interior
120	813	With only $1000 difference I'm going for the TSX
120	814	The engine is slightly noisier than my 08 TL, but 4 cyl
120	815	is expected to do that.
121	816	Overall the outer styling is top notch
121	817	The interior is nice but leaves room for improvement
121	818	The plastics are cheap and that cheapness is everywhere
121	819	The plastic scratches very very easily
121	820	My car has 4000 miles and looks like it has 50,000
121	821	It has only one 12 V adapter
121	822	Cup holders are way to far back, seat heater buttons are in a horrible location
121	823	The car runs and drives great with the 4cyl motor
121	824	This motor does take a bit to rev up but then the power kicks in
121	825	By no means is this car fast from the stop, if you want that get that Raliart model
121	826	I have already had the turn signal break and the rubber on the brake pedal fall off ( warranty items)
121	827	The gas mileage is not that great in town.
122	828	I have only had it for less than a month but everyday I love this car more and more
122	829	The nav, climate control, and other tech features it has takes a little time to get used to
122	830	It handles great, the ride is comfortable, and it looks awesome
123	831	Ford has really done there homework on this one
123	832	I traded in my 2007 Dodge Ram for my new 2009 F-150 the only thing I miss is the hemi engine
123	833	Other than the lack of a little power over the hemi this truck is light years better than the Dodge in every other way
123	834	This truck is fun to drive! The power from the new 5.4 is nothing to laugh at though
123	835	This will serve me just fine
123	836	The only thing I notice is the inside door panels push you in the truck to keep you away from the windows so as in an accident your not in the way of the side curtain air bags
123	837	This makes it just a little uncomfortable however nothing you couldn't get use to
123	838	Look around at this truck, you'll find a lot of neat things!
124	839	Awesome car, very well built, fun to drive, when you lay on the gas this little v-6 roars and keeps on pulling all the way up to the redline(6500 and sometimes 7000 yikes)hope it has good strong rods in it lol.
125	840	Just picked up my Jetta TDI Sportswagon last week and so far I'm loving it
125	841	Fun to drive, handles great, the turbo is a real kick
125	842	Perfect size after driving mini-vans for the last 19 years
125	843	Plenty of cargo area in the back, seats are comfortable
125	844	A/C works great and cools down the car within a couple of minutes
125	845	So far I'm still on my first tank of gas but at 175 miles I've only used a quarter of a tank of gas
125	846	Nice to finally have a car I look forward to driving
126	847	This week I drove the first new TL SH-AWD off the lot here in NYC and this car is nothing short of an absolute black top carving rocket
126	848	I drove the front wheel drive model which was nice but can't hold a candle to the power and handling of the SH-AWD version
126	849	The tight power and control carves through turns and is every bit the powerful car Acura has ever built
126	850	The Tech package give you everything you could need from a fast, clear nav system with tons of features, iPhone integration including music and phonebook
126	851	I owned a TL from the previous generation and this new version improves on everything that I didn't like about the old version and the SH-AWD makes it into the car I always wanted.
127	852	I've had my xB for 4 days now
127	853	The hardest thing about buying one was deciding between Stingray Metallic and Black
127	854	I chose Black because I figured Black would always be in style
127	855	It actually has a metallic gray look to it, which really sets it off
127	856	This car is so much fun to drive
127	857	It's quick, agile, and very responsive
127	858	Even with the A/C on, I can merge onto the expressway with no problem
127	859	The ride is comfortable, although my wife prefers the cushier seats in her Lexus
127	860	There is very little road or engine noise
127	861	The stock radio/CD player sounds great
127	862	We have 4 Toyotas in the family, and this one certainly does not disappoint
127	863	It has the same build quality as the others.
128	864	As usual, my new 2009 Honda Pilot is everything that you would expect from Honda - solid, reliable, fun, etc
128	865	It has all of the features of more expensive SUVs for a reasonable price
128	866	I don't have one bad thing to comment on.
129	867	I currently have 10,500 miles on my Traverse and I'm pretty happy with the comfort, performance and gas mileage the car has been getting
129	868	I drove a Tahoe before this and it's just as roomy and it gets better mileage
129	869	It's my first AWD car and I notice slipping when turning corners and rollback on inclines
129	870	Wondering if this is normal? 
130	871	The RAV4 provides an elevated driving position, good and adaptable carrying capacity and a comfortable ride
130	872	Economy, so far, has been very good at 24 MPG in suburban driving, near 30 MPG on the highway.
131	873	I purchased the CR-V about a month ago and find it OK
131	874	It has horrible road noise and a very jumpy ride on rough roads
131	875	I do not like the shape of the rear side window
131	876	Gas mileage is only fair 21 around town
131	877	I traded in a 2005 Toyota Camry and in many ways liked the Camry better
131	878	The Bridgestone tires on this vehicle get a very poor rating
131	879	I am surprised that Honda would put these tires on this vehicle
132	880	I knew this car would be fun to drive, but I didn't know that I would think it would be the funnest car I think I've ever even been in
132	881	I'm a automotive buff
132	882	I love to drive cars
132	883	I've driven many cars but this might just take the cake
132	884	I will admit, there are better looking cars that handle and perform as good as this but..
132	885	the cost about 10000 more
132	886	Not bad for its price
132	887	I can easily imagine keeping this car around for a min
132	888	of 7 years
132	889	Very pleased with the car
132	890	Comfort is nice
132	891	I sometimes drive 250 plus miles at a time and never think once that my legs or back is getting sore
132	892	Mpg average on ten tanks 22.4
132	893	Car has unbelievable grip and handling.
133	894	I love this vehicle!! I test drove every SUV on the market before buying this one
133	895	I drove the Porsche, Benz, the Toyota, Lexus, Ford, Dodge, and the BMW
133	896	None compare with the comfort and goodies that come with this one
133	897	Did I say I love it?? I owned a BMW X5 before buying this vehicle and there is no comparison in the ride, feel and comfort
133	898	This vehicle is by far the most outstanding of all the SUVs on the market
134	899	We have owned our minivan a year and a half and the check engine light has been on since 48hrs after we bought it
134	900	We have been to 3 different dealerships and nobody can fit it
134	901	My car juts forward and engine revs into the red as I am driving at least once a week
134	902	I have been told it is a new model and they are working on the kinks
134	903	I was also told it has a life time warranty, so why should I worry
134	904	I told them if my car blows up on the highway a warranty is not going to save my life or the car behind me hitting me when I jut
134	905	I can't wait for my lease to be up in another year and a half so they can have this lemon back
134	906	I will never buy a MiniVan again and never any Chrysler again!!
135	907	I've been driving this car for over 2 months now and I just love it! The power is really good for a 4cyl and gas mileage is what I had expected, good
135	908	What I love about it is that it didn't have to break my bank to get this nice cute car where you still look good enough to go on a date with and girl doesn't call you a loser for not driving a BMW, Lexus or Mercedes
135	909	I really like the reliability of Hondas
135	910	I've had Hondas all my life but just before this I bought a Mazda Tribute (Ford affiliated) and I can tell you that Honda is a much better built cars! I will never buy anything else other than Honda for the value! 
136	911	"I have only 2,000 miles on the vehicle but it performs as expected, secure, 34 mpg and a comfortable fit for 6'2"" guy"
136	912	The cruise control across the mountains of West Virginia is a little rough but expected
136	913	I'd recommend this car to everyone
136	914	Got the S model as a compromise with the wife.
137	915	...and its already in the shop
137	916	Evidently the radiator fan doesn't come on when the car is idling
137	917	Its quite a sight to see the engine temperature gauge go from 190 to 260 within 3 minutes
137	918	"Another example of VW's world renown ""quality"" or just an isolated incident? Who knows"
137	919	Just be aware
137	920	Up to that point we were waiting to be towed to the nearest dealership, I would have to agree with everyone else's initial impressions
137	921	It seems like a quality car, handles like a much smaller car, and is just a pleasure to drive and use
137	922	The tight design of the exterior really belies what is a comfortable interior
138	923	I thought I could never drive anything but an SUV
138	924	Been driving one since 1984
138	925	I just purchased my Fit in 1/09
138	926	I was surprised to find out I really do enjoy it
138	927	It's a little lower but other than that, I really don't miss all the bells and whistles, especially when I realized the gas mileage
138	928	It all evened out
138	929	I recommend this vehicle.
139	930	We owned a Mitsubishi Diamante VRX 03 model and were looking to replace it after 5 years of trouble free driving, and found out the Diamante was discontinued
139	931	The other car makes were all test driven and some stood out more than others, like the Passat and Maxima sedans, and then my wife and I drove the 09 Gallant Ralliart
139	932	Well it rekindled our love for Mitsubishi with the build quality in the car plus the wonderful 258 horsepower 3.8 MIVEC engine and sport shift automatic transmission
139	933	All we can say is we recieved more for our money and fun for our dollar!
140	934	I originally did not consider a Honda thinking it was going to be too expensive
140	935	"But after comparing costs with other ""less"" expensive options the Honda stood out"
140	936	Exterior has great stylings for a minivan and the interior is roomy and luxurious
140	937	Drives like a car
140	938	I can hardly wait for my first trip
140	939	Auto doors are a feature I never really thought about, but I love them
140	940	What's more the wife and kids love it
141	941	Thrilled every time I'm behind the wheel of my redline orange si
141	942	Nowadays, I look for every opportunity to run errands
141	943	Not only is driving a manual again after a decade's hiatus great fun, but doing so in this pocket rocket is even more exhilarating
141	944	Still under the 600 mile break in period, so I rarely take the rpm above 6000 rpm, yet still, this machine shows tremendous spunk off the starting block
141	945	Was close to getting a Civic EX coupe but am so relieved I followed my heart (instead of pocket- book) to settle for this Si coupe
141	946	For three grand more, I know I got a car that stirs excitement and delivers both reliability and fun
142	947	My Suburban died and I needed a car so I saw the Flex and loved it but bought an Explorer
142	948	Gave the Explorer to my teens and got myself the Flex! I love the car
142	949	"I was not ready to give up the space of a Suburban so the Flex fits that need but I feel like I am driving a luxury sedan! The extra features of the LTD make it a great transistion car from the mom carpool to the adults have fun car! It handles island driving around all the curves and pot holes just great! A 6""3"" friend of my son told him it was the most comfortable back seat he had ever been in! My teenage son loves the sound system and sits in the driveway playing around with the bass and tremble! The Flex is MY car!"
143	950	After only 3 weeks and 300 km of winter grid road travel, all 4 wheelwells and all 4 mudguards are damaged
143	951	"1 mudguard has a 4"" diameter hole clear through it"
143	952	"I am fortunate enough that my dealer is replacing all 4+4 free of charge in addition to coating them with a rubber compound calling it a ""Goodwill"" repair"
143	953	My maximum grid road speed was always less than 100 km/hr
143	954	The odd thing is, there is basically NO gravel left on the road since it's not graded in the winter..
143	955	currently the maximum particle size is only ~5mm.
144	956	My husband and I researched and drove every vehicle in this class
144	957	In our opinion, the Tiguan is simply the better vehicle all the way around
144	958	Build quality, styling, design, interior layout, handling, braking and acceleration (the turbo was smooth and peppy) are all excellent
145	959	I was originally reluctant to purchase a MB due to what I had heard regarding quality issues in the past
145	960	I must say that so far this car has been perfect, no issues whatsoever, great build quality with no rattles or squeaks
145	961	I did have to replace the OEM tires after 4200 miles due to wear, but other then that the car has performed better then I expected
145	962	The car is FAST but also drives well on the highway for normal cruising
145	963	The electronic package is top notch as well
145	964	The HK stereo is great sounding, the navigation is clear to understand, and the voice recognition is far better then what my Acura has
145	965	Overall I would buy this car again with no hesitation.
146	966	Just bought this vehicle after extensive research, including BMW 335i, 535i, Infiniti M35/45, among others
146	967	This vehicle was the best value from a features & performance per dollar standpoint
146	968	The BMW's had a slight edge on drive experience and handling, but not enough to warrant the higher price and sacrifice on all other features
146	969	The technology inside the CTS is incredible, with only a few annoying exceptions (see below)
146	970	I am very happy with this car and look forward to driving it every day
146	971	It has great curb appeal and is a vehicle that makes you feel great when driving it
146	972	If you like music, then you'll esp love it
146	973	Between the ipod interface, 40G hard drive, and XM, you can't ever run out.
147	974	Was told by dealer the a/c cycles cold to warm so it won't freeze up! I have owned a lot of cars domestic and import and I never had this problem before
147	975	Where I live the summer temps run 95-110 June to October
147	976	Because of this I would not recommend or buy another Subaru.
148	977	This car has been a pleasure to own and drive
148	978	I have a long commute every day and this vehicle very comfortable-- smooth ride, spacious, comfy seats, low cabin noise
148	979	This car has TONS of trunk/storage room, way more than I expected and also has lots of head room
148	980	It does great with gas mileage and has plenty of pick-up on the highway
148	981	The SL is definitely worth the extra money
148	982	It has a much nicer interior and a center console (S does not).
149	983	One of the roomiest cars I have owned in a long time
149	984	I am as comfortable in this car as I am in my Silverado Pick-up
149	985	I am over 6' tall and it is one of the few cars I have been in that I can't reach the pedals with the seat all the way back
149	986	Dealership was great
149	987	For the price, warranty and dealer support you cannot beat it.
150	988	I've had my red Malibu LTZ V6 almost 2 weeks and I absolutely love it
150	989	"It looks like a million bucks - everywhere I go people ask me, ""What kind of car is that? It's so pretty!"" It drives like a 4 door sports car and handles like a dream"
150	990	So far it is getting 30-31 mpg on the hwy and 18-22 in the city
150	991	It seems to get a higher avg mpg as I get a few more miles on it
150	992	The OnStar nav is great as I have no sense of direction
150	993	The seats are beautiful and comfortable and the trunk is roomy enough for a trip for 4 for a few days in N.O
150	994	The elec plug in the back is awesome
150	995	Everyday I find more to love about this car! I feel like a celebrity when I drive it because everybody stares at it
151	996	Rides like a sedan and accelerates quickly but the engine screams trying
151	997	"Fit and finish is good as well as good legroom/headroom for a 6'4"" guy"
151	998	I expected better mileage than 22 MPG since my previous Sequoia, with a V8, got 20.5 MPG
151	999	The sticker stated 24 MPG on the highway and it doesn't come close.
152	1000	I have been driving my Ford Edge Limited since March 09, and all I have to say so far is that I Love It!! The main reason why I picked it over the other vehicles I was considering was the technology package
152	1001	You get so much more for the money compared to other vehicles
152	1002	The exterior designed is powerful and I love the way it drives! 
153	1003	Compared this car with other models and brands
153	1004	Clearly ahead of the competition
153	1005	Styling, interior room, sporty handling and more than enough power
153	1006	Fuel economy as advertised
153	1007	Loaded with technology
153	1008	Was about to purchase an X5
153	1009	After driving the Q5 and comparing space, feel and price, the Q won hands down
153	1010	Great car!
154	1011	I just turned in a 2006 FX
154	1012	I loved that car because it had versatility and handled like a sports sedan
154	1013	When I went back to the Infiniti dealership to check out an '09 FX, the new version just didn't whet my appetite
154	1014	Too exotic maybe
154	1015	I test drove a G37X and wow! Now that's a sports sedan! I gave up some storage and SUV driving height, but came away with a rocket ship on wheels, that is as tight as a drum
154	1016	I had test driven a BMW 328X also and this car is as tight as that but with ample more power
154	1017	The 328 is not even in the same class power wise.
155	1018	Since buying this car in July, it has been in the shop 3 times for a thunk in the front end--which they are replacing parts, but it's still there and now I am dealing with an odor in the car that smells like BO (body odor)
155	1019	There are issues with this car and right now I am not a happy Hyundai owner
155	1020	I would hold off buying a 2009 until they figure out some issues with the car
155	1021	This is a brand new car, should not be in the shop already.
156	1022	This car is incredible! Drive experience so comfortable you don't really care about getting to your destination! The real surprise- my fuel economy has been a solid 21.5 mpg driving 90% city 10% highway
156	1023	This car hauls large items well
156	1024	I put an 8ft potted tree in the back in front of several skeptical on-lookers
156	1025	I have had not one problem with this car and it was delivered with 0 defects
156	1026	Warning: if you drive one, you'll want one!
157	1027	This is my very first car and I know I made a great choice
157	1028	It takes less than $25 to fill up my tank and I am good for the rest of the week
157	1029	The interior is comfortable and I get compliments on the exterior
157	1030	For a first car or something that in inexpensive and good to drive get this car
157	1031	It is also roomy for my family of four.
158	1032	 Excellent exterior and interior styling; interior is understated and straightforward with intuitive controls
158	1033	Trunk and backseat are both surprisingly roomy (best in class) for a retractable hardtop
158	1034	Roof function is smooth and quick
158	1035	Low-end torque is a little weak, but the turbo makes for a zippy little passer once it is underway
158	1036	Fuel economy is great
158	1037	This car is a well- kept secret, making it pretty unique
159	1038	I just bought this turned in my 07 and wow what a difference for only 2 years
159	1039	You can notice a little more pickup, the 07 525 was a real dog
159	1040	The handling and suspension, what can you say it's a BMW, I told myself I'd buy a Genesis or try something new, but for an enthusiast driver, THERE IS NO COMPARISON TO THE FEEL OF A BMW this car is soo tight.
160	1041	I've owned many M-B's since 1984
160	1042	This is a very nice car, but after a month, I wish I'd gotten the C350
160	1043	I also have an '06 Porsche Carerra S Cab and just turned in an '07 E350
160	1044	It has P1,P2,Nav,18's and Panoramic Roof
160	1045	All that stuff works great, but the seats are not as comfortable as my E350 was
160	1046	My two major gripes are the brakes and power
160	1047	I do 70% freeway driving and at 65 mph, this motor has limited passing ability
160	1048	Punch it and it makes a lot of noise, but takes an hour to get around a big rig, especially on an uphill grade
160	1049	I guess it depends on what you're used to
160	1050	Additionally, the car is 'underbraked'
160	1051	You really feel the brakes straining to bring the car down when needed.
161	1052	Loved this car so much
161	1053	Outstanding fuel economy: Mix driving 42 mpg (with fastest speed up to 75mph and slowest is 40mph)- City driving is from 35 to 37 mpg
161	1054	My new Fit has less than 300 miles on it
161	1055	Too sure it will get up to between 47 and 50 mpg (mix driving) easily when engine breaks in
161	1056	Great visibility
161	1057	Looks great both in and out
161	1058	Beautiful interior
161	1059	Spacious
161	1060	Magic seats
161	1061	Great handling
161	1062	Fun to drive
161	1063	Exceeded EPA rating (27/33/30)---> NEW EPA RATING SHOULD BE: 35/45/42
162	1064	I purchased my 2nd Murano in November of '08
162	1065	Traded my '03 Muranowith 95,000 miles
162	1066	I am not disappointed with new vehicle
162	1067	Many improvements over previous model
162	1068	Navagation system awesome, radio great with recording feature
162	1069	Ride very good but noisy with moon roof open
162	1070	"I miss the memory seat that Nissan decided to remove from the ""09--had it in the '03"
162	1071	Don't understand that decision? Overall, very satisfied, would highly recommend
162	1072	I can fit 4 sets of golf clubs across the back of trunk
162	1073	Try that in any other SUV out there, including Lexus RX, Lincoln MKX, Ford Edge--no way! I tried it already
162	1074	Doesn't sound like a deal breaker, unless you are a golfer!
163	1075	The dealer was wonderful
163	1076	Got a very good price for the vehicle
163	1077	The vehicle it self is excellent for me, a single male living on my own
163	1078	It gets around town very well, the freeway drive is comfortable
163	1079	The audio sounds good, and AC cools well
163	1080	The steering wheel is a little touchy, but that could be me who use to own a 96 Mercury
163	1081	The brakes are great, and the layout of the interior is excellent
163	1082	Overall this vehicle was the best value out there..
163	1083	Hyundai has awesome rebates, check your local dealer
163	1084	Going one on one with Honda, this car offers the same as a honda that cost 1500-2000 more
164	1085	This is a SLT Quad cab With the 5.7 Hemi
164	1086	I have to say, this truck was long overdue
164	1087	After test driving all of the 2009 competitors, this monster handles all of them in just about every catagory
164	1088	Where else can you get 390HP w/407FTlb torque and still get 14 City & 20 Hwy? The rear coil-overs make rear leaf springs a thing of the past
164	1089	I pull a 3000 lb boat&trailer, and have never used the Tow/haul feature
164	1090	Build quality this year is drastically improved inside and out
164	1091	This was the last truck I had in mind when I started shopping, but its in my driveway today.(with no regrets so far)
165	1092	This is a great car
165	1093	I researched MBZ first, having driven 240Ds for 20 years
165	1094	This car is powerful, handy, and responsive
165	1095	Mercedes lost out with half the fuel economy and much higher prices for diesel models
166	1096	Spent a lot of time researching TSX's over several months
166	1097	Driving the 2nd gen compared to the 1st gen was night and day
166	1098	This is arguably the best car on the market under $30k for what the car offers as standard features
166	1099	Bought mine 12/31/08, am 5,000 miles in, and still have a smile on my face every time that I drive it
166	1100	GREAT vehicle for Road trips
166	1101	Overall, a very economical car
166	1102	For a smoother ride, I recommend not putting on aftermarket low-profile tires/rims.
167	1103	I've had this truck for about 4 months and I'm very satisfied with my purchase
167	1104	I was a little concerned that the engine might be a bit wimpy but I find it can hold its own in traffic with no problems
167	1105	Everything seems to be working well
167	1106	No unexpected wind noise or squeaks, and my radio works great.
168	1107	I've been driving my TSX for a month now and I like it a lot except for the ride quality
168	1108	The suspension is way too stiff and the ride is jittery on any surface (as noted in Consumer Report)
168	1109	I'm told that it will soften with time
168	1110	I hope so
168	1111	The 5.1 sound system is outstanding
168	1112	I don't have a problem with the nav screen because I'm short but I can see that if I was several inches higher in the seat, I would see the reflection of the windows in the nav screen
168	1113	Not good
168	1114	Excellent build quality overall and no problem whatsoever so far
168	1115	I'll report again later in the year.
169	1116	We bought this car for my wife to run around town and back and forth to work
169	1117	We traded in a 2000 Nissan Xterra and my wife is very happy with it so am I! We average 30 mpg city and 40-42 Hwy (safe range is about 400 miles on the Hwy) The 1.8 auto has plenty of get up and go and the transmission is fantastic
169	1118	Ride and handling is good, electric steering requires correct driving form on the hwy (both hands on the wheel) around town its great for parking
169	1119	We recently took it on a 1200 mile road trip loaded up with 2 adults and young child very comfortable although the door armrests are annoyingly low
169	1120	We have always owned Toyota or Nissan, our old 93 Tercel had over 200,000 miles when sold.
170	1121	I may have had the first 09 335i in all of CA while the rest were stuck in customs at the Long Beach Port in LA
170	1122	This car is great! Fast, tight, great control, nice new body look with minor changes in the 09 in the exterior as well as on the interior
170	1123	iDrive is so much better then old system
170	1124	Great maps, options, usability, hard drive! And with the new twin Turbo which does its part to conserve gas this beast has power when you need it, and style when you are just rolling
170	1125	Perfect mix of luxury and sport
170	1126	The back seat is too small, but I guess thats why there is a 5 series.
171	1127	This is my second 427 Corvette, the first being a 1966 and needless to say the difference between night and day
171	1128	I like most every experience I have had with the car, from the dealer on down
171	1129	This car was meant to be driven every day if need be
171	1130	One has to remember this is a sports car and not a Cadillac and so it rides like a sports car, no problem there
171	1131	There are so many after market things that can be done to this car and the service manuals make it easy on the DIY?rs
171	1132	Out there on the road there are not too many cars that can hang with you regardless of price
171	1133	It's a gentleman in town and a warrior on the road
171	1134	Love the Cyber Grey
172	1135	We were on our way to test drive a new Camry
172	1136	Took a swing into the Mazda dealer because I knew the design had changed and wanted to check it out
172	1137	After a test drive we kept our appointment w/ the Toyota dealer
172	1138	This Mazda has it all over the Camry, I couldn't even get alloy wheels on the LE model (which really pi**ed me off)
172	1139	Short story, we went back to Mazda and got a good deal on a car (so far, 2 mos) that I think is nicer than the Camry (which is a very nice car).
173	1140	We purchased the car at the end of March
173	1141	Most of our driving is in the Minneapolis metro area
173	1142	No trips over 100 miles one way
173	1143	We like the car a lot and are happy with the purchase
173	1144	It's an enjoyable car to drive if you like quiet and good handling
173	1145	We're averaging 38-40 mpg per tank
173	1146	We too have had the Check Engine light issue concerning the gas cap
173	1147	(4 times in 7400 miles.) This past Wednesday night our dealership told us that Toyota will be coming out soon with a Tech Service Bulletin
173	1148	The gas tank neck is faulty and has to be replaced
173	1149	Ours is scheduled for next week
173	1150	Supposedly with a new, improved one.
174	1151	Traded in my 2000 A6 2.7T on the CC
174	1152	I am very pleased with the of the car overall
174	1153	While not as luxurious or powerful as my old Audi, it's hard to believe this car can be had for under 26k
174	1154	It looks and feels like a much more expensive car and the 2 tone leatherette interior is top notch
174	1155	The clutch is very light and the 6 speed manual is satisfying
174	1156	This is a great car! I hope it proves to be reliable long term vehicle
174	1157	That was my only concern repurchasing from this German brand
175	1158	What is not to like about a quality 4x4 6 cylinder SUV for $16K
175	1159	Electric windows, power locks, cd player, excellent in the snow
175	1160	Only one problem was the right side power mirror stopped working
175	1161	Will wait for a month and see if any other little things pop up
175	1162	The best deal is a 10 year / 100,000 mile warranty
175	1163	Come on now see if you can come close to Toyota and Honda with this kind of deal
175	1164	I researched this hard before I bought and I am please as punch to get this great car
175	1165	Time will tell how it stand up but so far so good.
176	1166	Got this towards the very end of the clunker deal
176	1167	I settled on getting the Touring after looking at a variety of hatchbacks, from a Nissan Versa at the low-end to a Subaru Impreza at the high end
176	1168	Unfortunately for me, these things are extremely popular and after looking for one for nearly 2 weeks, I got the color I wanted (Vivid Blue) but I didn't get the premium package I wanted in time(sun roof, etc.) Immediately noticed is the quality of the interior and how pleasing it is to look at
176	1169	I'd say only the Mazda3speed is more sporty looking
176	1170	Got the Automatic & drives like a breeze
176	1171	Not real sporty but way more so than my old Pathfinder
176	1172	All in all, a great car! Highly recommend it! 
177	1173	Premium Plus w/nav in Ibis White I had never really considered an Audi until I drove the Q5
177	1174	It clearly is a well-thought out vehicle and very much fun to drive
177	1175	Regular Drive mode leaves a little to be desired in first and second but Sport mode (and Triptronic) is where the fun is...0-60 in FAST! MMI is solid, cargo space may not be as large as some others but that was not a factor for me (don't have 22 kids and 3 dogs to shuttle around), gas mileage seems to be above listed, visibility is very good, steering responsive but not overly sensitive, braking is predictable, road noise is low even on 19s, and the most important factor is that it feels like a sedan and drives like one.
178	1176	What can you say except wow
178	1177	Just a sweet looking car that is super fun to drive
178	1178	We receive compliments everywhere we travel, from the tires and rims to the well appointed interior space
179	1179	I was originally looking at Honda CRV and Toyota Rav4, but was concerned about their blind spots and bad rear visibility for backing up
179	1180	So I looked at the Subaru (with AMAZING visibility in ALL directions) and sold on the appearance, performance and features
179	1181	The Subaru Symetrical AWD is also superior to the 4WD technology on Honda and Toyota
179	1182	Regarding other reviews: The base trim does not have cup holders in the back seat center console, but ALL trims have cup holders embedded in the back doors (perhaps the other reviewers haven't noticed?)
179	1183	The radio seems just fine to me
179	1184	The passenger seat is low, but not a showstopper
179	1185	The driver seat is very comfortable in the Limited trim.
180	1186	This truck has had transmission issues since the day I bought it
180	1187	Toyota refuses to admit it is a problem, even though it is well documented on the internet
180	1188	Transmission continually slips when accelerating after a turn or even going over a speed bump
180	1189	There is a clunking/jumping effect around 30mph when letting off gas then getting back on the gas
180	1190	Also have had an annoying buzzing sound from under my glove compartment and a rattling window control panel
180	1191	Body dents very easily
180	1192	Very worried that transmission will fail before my 36k warranty.
181	1193	Beautiful car! The only complaint I have is I wish it had more horsepower
181	1194	I have a G35 coupe which has 280HP, and going down to 228HP is a little change
181	1195	The ride is awesome
182	1196	Great car overall, but the clutch pedal is a bit too heavy for regular city stop and go driving
182	1197	I live in Philly and all Infiniti dealers are located in the suburbs
182	1198	The suburban test drive and the back roads that showed off the handling really didn't reveal how tiring the clutch pedal would become in the city environment where I reside
182	1199	I have a 2006 Honda Element with manual trans that is a pleasure to drive in the city with its light clutch and precise shift action
182	1200	It's very, very similar to the BMW 3 Series that I recently test drove
182	1201	If I could have driven the Infiniti in the city for a day or two I probably would not have purchased it despite its other wonderful virtues.
183	1202	"Some ""professional"" reviews talk about the 5 speed trans being ""jerky."" At 13 miles on the clock, it was"
183	1203	By 200 miles, it had smoothed out considerably
183	1204	It could be a mechanical form of tromp loi, but everything sounds solid about the Aveo
183	1205	The handling is sensitive but precise enough for me
183	1206	Mileage has been as advertised
183	1207	Everyone who has ridden with me comments about the roominess and exelent visibility
183	1208	With the LS you get the basic car and so is reminisent of Pinto, Vega, Colt, Civic of the past (had 'em all) but somehow a little more evolved
183	1209	The option packages seem a little lop- sided
183	1210	Time will tell on reliability, but for now I have no issues and enjoy my new ride every day.
184	1211	I love the car, it is quiet, low road noise
184	1212	But, it burns oil
184	1213	At 600 miles I have had to put in a half quart already
184	1214	Furthermore, you would think for a car that burns so much oil, it would come with a dipstick, but, it does not
184	1215	I wish I would have researched problems like this before buying
184	1216	I do regret my decision now, oh, and for Audi, the current oil consumption is within their limits so, I drive with oil in my trunk at all times.
185	1217	I just bought a hatchback Yaris because it was a Toyota and I wanted a small car w/good mileage
185	1218	I previously owned a VW beetle which I loved but it was getting too costly to own - so I went w/a Toyota mainly because of the reliability of the company
185	1219	I owned Toyotas in the past and a Honda - I would've bought a Honda Fit but it was more expensive than the Yaris
186	1220	Well, it has only been 3 days but this truck is awesome, way better than my 99 taco x-cab 4 banger 4x4
186	1221	Fit and finish are excellent
186	1222	Ride rivals that of my wifes grand Cherokee (car like)
186	1223	Only thing I am having trouble with is you cant hear the engine and it is a manual tranny
186	1224	I have always just shifted on instinct and now I have to use a tach
186	1225	I guess the trade off is the very quiet ride
186	1226	All the standard safety features are nice (6 airbags, trac cont, 4 wheel abs all base model stuff now)
186	1227	I will get the monitor for the tailgate cam, will help with hooking up the trailer
186	1228	This is my 8th Toyota vehicle, and it appears they have hit yet another grand slam.
187	1229	I bought this car earlier this month and absolutely love it
187	1230	I did a LOT of research on 2009 sedans (including Camry, Accord, Jetta, and Altima) before deciding on the Accord
187	1231	The Accord is top-notch As soon as you get in it you feel like you are sitting in a luxury car that should be much more expensive than a Honda
187	1232	And performance is great! I am very pleased with the car...except for 1 thing---the headlights dim just a bit about every 15-20 seconds when the AC is on
187	1233	The only reason I noticed it was because I was looking for it (I had read about it in some of the reviews)
187	1234	However, this is not a big enough problem to keep me from loving my car!! Honda's reliability is excellent.
188	1235	This is one of the best cars I have driven
188	1236	The last car I drove constantly was a Jaguar X-Type Sport and I would still pick the MINI over the Jag
188	1237	Great classic look and a really fun interior
188	1238	Handles like a go kart
188	1239	I do wish that I could have a little more power
188	1240	I also wish I had bought a sunroof.
189	1241	I bought my Tahoe LT 2009 (white) Jan 24th 2009
189	1242	I like space and the top view because of the SUV design
189	1243	The door rubber seals need to improve, if you open the driver door you can see poor wilding Pocket left and right Pumpers (front _ down) which can store dirty wet material, need to add protection screen for the tires to protect the SUV both sides from (splash) 
190	1244	Traded an older F-150 and wanted a new truck that had the same features
190	1245	I'm glad I did because it performs better than expected
190	1246	I priced other trucks in the same class and found this new F- 150 has a far better exterior
190	1247	It's quieter and the interior was tops for the money compared to a Dodge, Chevy, or GMC
190	1248	First week after purchasing the truck it turned heads and had people coming up to me in parking lots just to say what a great looking truck it was!! After a long drive with the family (over 8 hours), even my mother-in-law had to say that it's a hell of a truck in comfort, ride, and interior space
190	1249	She even liked the look and price! 
191	1250	Okay...At first I didn't like the styling of the new TL
191	1251	But I have to admit it has grown on me
191	1252	I love the sexy shape, the way it handles, and the well designed interior
191	1253	Before purchasing the TL, I test drove the Lexus IS 250 and the BMW 325I
191	1254	The IS was too slow (4cyl engine in a 35K dollar vehicle??) and the BMW didn't offer much in terms of standard equipment
191	1255	I basically chose the TL as I felt I got more bang for my buck
191	1256	And we all know Acura makes quality vehicles
192	1257	After much research, this is by far the best car in it's class for value, quality, warranty, and standard features
192	1258	The ride is excellent, tight road hugging suspension and great handling
192	1259	The 2.4L engine is surprisingly strong and much easier on gas than the V6
192	1260	Interior is quiet, very pleasing to the eye
192	1261	All electronics are well placed and easy to see
192	1262	Leather seats are very comfortable
192	1263	Exterior has great lines with chrome accents and the cocoa metallic finish is beautiful in the sunlight
192	1264	"The 17"" wheels and low profile tires are a great accent"
192	1265	Trunk space is huge and rear seats fold down with access to the trunk
192	1266	Nice headroom in rear
192	1267	Great savings with CARS and rebates
193	1268	This is a great car, rides nice, love the color, Sangria Red on the SES model with the standard spoiler and the SYNC system! Great handling
194	1269	Favorite Features
195	1270	Been Toyota Tacoma driver for 14 years
195	1271	Frontier seems ok so far
195	1272	Rides a little ruff, think it's going to be a rattling truck
195	1273	Hearing some noises already, bought on 7/31
195	1274	Stereo is very nice so w/volume up can't hear noises
195	1275	4cy automatic doesn't do too well w/cruise on
195	1276	Like roominess cab, love access doors
195	1277	Bigger than my 1995 Tacoma so I'm getting used to tighter turning radius
195	1278	Did cash for clunker & couldn't get Toyota
195	1279	If I had do overs I might would have taken my chances on waiting to get Tacoma, that was my 1st choice
195	1280	Just not sure it's going to last me 14 years like last truck
195	1281	On this review, I'm not sure I chose the right style
195	1282	It's 4Cy, king cab, power package, full bed 
196	1283	I traded in my 2005 LX for the 2009 EX
196	1284	First, resale value is sweet! Mine was a lease that I went about 20K miles over
196	1285	I traded it in rather than returning it and after the lease payoff the dealer cut me a check! Overall, I love the new Accord
196	1286	I disagree with a lot of people and find the seats very comfortable
196	1287	For those that don't, READ the owners manual on proper adjustment of the head rest; there is a page on that and it makes a big difference
196	1288	As for brake issues and MPG, both are great for me
196	1289	If yours is not, try relaxing when you drive.
197	1290	Picked the Corolla for several reasons
197	1291	Familiar with Toyota quality and reliability
197	1292	Car looks awesome! Super White looks fantasic
197	1293	The 2.4L performs well and is quiet, handles very well and is a blast to shift through the gears
197	1294	Very smooth and easy to drive and all controls are placed well in the cabin
197	1295	Build quality seems very good at this point
197	1296	Time will tell.
198	1297	I turned my 2001 protege ES over to my son, it has 157,000 miles and not a problem
198	1298	I just filled up the tank (half empty) looks like 28 mpg (city & highway)
198	1299	I love the ride, handles like a sports car, not a problem and don't expect any
198	1300	Bought car for my wife because she loved the other Mazda so much (I get to drive it once in a while)
198	1301	Going to tint windows; it warmed up pretty quick inside
198	1302	"If I had to pick one word for Mazda it would be ""Quality"""
199	1303	I test drove infiniti, Lexus, Toyota
199	1304	I kept looking at murano and for some reason moved on
199	1305	But after going thru all the rest I came back
199	1306	The exterior styling had been my initial attraction but the cft transmission had been the putoff
199	1307	Boy was I wrong
199	1308	This murano drives like an infiniti/Lexus
199	1309	Soft ride with lots of pep and no hesitation
199	1310	Flying on the interstate it glided effortlessly thru rush hour, dead quiet to wind & traffic noise
199	1311	I hated to park it it was such fun.
200	1312	 OK, I only have the Sonata a couple of weeks but I am very very happy with the car
200	1313	The power is impressive for a four cylinder and the gas mileage is great, avg 29 MPG all around
200	1314	That avg is highway and city combined
200	1315	It has a classy interior that is well layed out and very comfortable
200	1316	I bought the Sonata to replace an Elantra, 77K miles, that I gave to my son
200	1317	He needed a car
200	1318	This is my seventh Hyundai
200	1319	I traded a Land Rover for a Santa Fe, which I still own
200	1320	I made a great trade
200	1321	To date I've had no issues with any of my Hyundai
200	1322	I plan to look at the new Genesis Coupe when it hits the showroom floor
200	1323	I got the Sonata at an I can't pass it up deal, $12400 for the GLS automatic.
201	1324	My 11 and 13 year old daughters love the Journey
201	1325	They like to fold down the seats and stretch out during road trips
201	1326	AC plug keeps all the electronic goodies charged
201	1327	Beverages in the chill zone, snacks under the floor and movies playing on the DVD
201	1328	I consider the Journey a good value
201	1329	I paid less than 24K with AWD, 3 row seating, MyGig, Infinity Speakers and Sirius radio
201	1330	I could not price anything within $5k that seated more than 5
201	1331	I frequently recommend the Journey to others
201	1332	PS I think the MyGig radio below the heating controls works better in bright light.
202	1333	Great functionality - particularly for hauling kids w/ the third row seating
202	1334	If a mini-van is not an option for aesthetics or other personal reasons, the pilot is a good blend that gives you the functionality of a mini-van with the appearance of an SUV and a very robust SUV at that.
203	1335	I have this car about a couple of weeks and I just love this car
203	1336	I looked at Honda Fit and Toyota Yaris
203	1337	I see these cars on Route 1 and they look too small for that kind of Highway
203	1338	I wanted 1.8 L not 1.5 like Fit and Yaris
203	1339	Interior is roomy and it feels like a big car
203	1340	It's zippy and I am very comfortable on highways
204	1341	I traded two vehicles: an '03 Murano SL AWD and '05 350Z Roadster after realizing that it is no longer practical for me to have 2 vehicles requiring premium fuel
204	1342	I purchased a black on black w/leather LE loaded with the dual panel roof instead of a DVD player
204	1343	This car is an absolute delight to drive and I'm amazed at the amount of room as well as the creature comforts
204	1344	When you press the accelerator, it responds effortlessly
204	1345	20hp more than my '03 and seems like about the same mileage with mid-grade fuel
204	1346	If you select a black one, only use microfiber cloths on the exterior and say good-bye to automatic car washers
205	1347	Wanted to get up higher in traffic for visibility so went looking at crossovers and SUVs
205	1348	Test drove the X5 and the X6
205	1349	NO CONTEST
205	1350	The X6 has sedan like handling characteristics and had better performance
205	1351	There really IS a difference between the X5's 3.0i and the X6's 3.5i
206	1352	I love my xB! I have 800+ miles on my xB at the moment
206	1353	It's quick, I'm averaging around 27mpg, rides nicely and is comfortable
206	1354	It really is a vehicle for everyone
206	1355	Older/disabled folks will love that it's easy to get in and out of and younger people will love how amazing xB's look lowered with different wheels/tires
206	1356	The sound system is great for stock
206	1357	Although it's not recommended, some people do light towing with their xB's (such as one Waverunner or one ATV)
206	1358	Visibility is quite good
206	1359	Windows are large and you have a great view of everything
206	1360	The xB is very safe as well.
207	1361	We started looking for an SUV and wasn't sure what direction to go
207	1362	My father in-law has a Yukon SLT and loves it
207	1363	I have always been anti American when it comes to vehicles, I always stuck with Japanese
207	1364	We also own a 07 Honda Pilot EX-L(w/nav) and absolutely love it, however my wife wanted something more roomy
207	1365	So our search began
207	1366	We looked at Toyota Sequoia....way too pricey, even the base SR5
207	1367	Then we looked at Nissan Armada's, not bad but poor fuel economy, and drive too much like a truck
207	1368	Then we drove an Expedition(Eddie Bauer), I was not impressed with the fit and finish and the steering was way too touchy
207	1369	Then we drove our first Tahoe..I was impressed
207	1370	Two days later we bought one
208	1371	I researched and drove multiple cars for months before deciding the V6 Navi was the best decision for the $
208	1372	I wanted the coupe, but the back seat was a non-starter for adults
208	1373	Awesome sound system! Mileage not what I expected from the VCM engine, and I drive with a light foot
208	1374	Navi isn't intuitive yet, but I hope to be better with it after a couple months
208	1375	The climate control system is exceptional
208	1376	People I talk to through blue tooth say the sound quality is very good
208	1377	Exceptionally fine handling and steering
208	1378	After 4 Hondas and 3 Mercedes, I'm sold on Honda
208	1379	Why pay twice as much for an unreliable Mercedes when you can have a car like this?
209	1380	I traded in my 2002 Camry XLE with 162,000 miles on it
209	1381	What a great car that was! Of course with such a great experience I had to consider the new Camry
209	1382	It is much sleeker in design although it is still Rather bland
209	1383	It is very quiet and smooth which is important to me as I do a lot of hwy driving
209	1384	The seats are comfortable but not quite up to my 2002
209	1385	Toyota did cut some corners with interior quality but overall it is still excellent
209	1386	It is also a little smaller inside than my 2002 although they claim it is larger? I also am not a huge fan of the deep dash board and the fact that you sit a bit higher then the previous model
209	1387	The stereo is good but not as crisp in sound as it could be.
210	1388	"What a car! Style-wise, Mazda hit a grand-slam: roomy 4-door practicality with unique sporty 2-door styling & so many features per $! Really nice 17"" alloys"
210	1389	Stock audio system pretty good
210	1390	Keyless start system rocks! Awesome dash layout & display at night
210	1391	Super- smooth & quiet ride
210	1392	Comfy seats
210	1393	Perfect steering feel
210	1394	Glides over curvy roads & corners with grace
210	1395	SO fun-to-drive! Doors yield loud THUNK when shut! Greatest surprise: Even with 5spd auto trans, the 170hp 2.5 4cyl engine routinely leaves other cars in my rearview mirror from full stops with little effort
210	1396	Even outperforms the 170hp v6 in my '98 626LX despite being much larger car
210	1397	Generates refined, throaty growl
210	1398	Superb!!!
211	1399	I owned a 2006 Chevy Equinox and I traded up for this vehicle
211	1400	I definitely traded up! The Chevy's interior left a lot to be desired and after a while I grew tired of the exterior as well
211	1401	With my new CR-V I feel like I'm definitely driving in style
211	1402	My main goal was to increase my mpg average without sacrificing space and comfort
211	1403	I have a very large dog and thought a car might get better mileage, she would not have her own space
211	1404	With the CR-V I get car style mileage and SUV style space
211	1405	The perfect combination
211	1406	If you're looking for that combination as well as great interior and exterior style and finish, then you've found the one to get
211	1407	I've had it for two weeks now and have ZERO regrets.
212	1408	We traded in our 2002 Monte Carlo SS two weeks ago for this Corolla S
212	1409	My main motivation was gas mileage
212	1410	I didn't expect to find a car that can get 35 mpg and zip up the mountains where I live
212	1411	I carpool with my wife to work 35 miles each way and it is a comfortable, quiet ride
212	1412	The car has enough power to climb the hills and handles great through the back roads
212	1413	"I thought I would be sorry letting the Monte Carlo go, but with the S I can still ""play"" when the mood hits"
212	1414	Oh, my wife almost got a speeding ticket..
212	1415	over 100 mph! Thank goodness the highway patrol was busy with someone else! If this car lives up to the Toyota name over the next 7 years, as I expect, I'll be very happy.
213	1416	My wife would not give up her matrix XRS without a nose bashing bleeding fight
213	1417	Guile and love on my part got her to try out the Venza and it was love on first sight
213	1418	If you travel two or three long trips a year yet need conveyance that won't tire both your wallet and patience and combine camping with urban driving, while keeping the kids happy, then this is the car for you
213	1419	My wife was never one to enjoy attention but even she likes the looks she is getting
213	1420	and the kids look up through the roof in the rear and all you hear is silence
213	1421	Need I say more
213	1422	All you parents out there at least give it a look over, this car (suv?) does not need a salesman.
214	1423	We chose the Pilot over the Buick Enclave and traded in our Buick Ranier (which we had thoroughly enjoyed for almost 5 years)
214	1424	The Pilot has more than exceeded our expectations and, at this point, is the most enjoyable vehicle we have ever owned
214	1425	Increased gas mileage over the Ranier is also a plus
214	1426	The Pilot has the best-designed and most usable, roomy interior we have ever seen
214	1427	Combine that with a striking exterior and fun-to-drive performance, then wrap it up in Honda dependability and you have a package that is hard to beat
214	1428	Did I mention that the Pilot was $6000 less than the Enclave? We also own a Honda Ridgeline and love both of our Hondas!
215	1429	While this sedan is probably one of the best around, make sure you test drive
215	1430	The VCM at 65-75 MPH is constantly changing between the 3-4 modes and can cause jerking response
215	1431	It is noticeable, causes nausea
215	1432	Make sure you are ok with this
215	1433	Be aware that the car must be warmed up for the VCM to work
215	1434	Using cruise control and holding your right foot extremely still helps
215	1435	Otherwise just drive 95+ to keep it in 6 mode
215	1436	Everything else is just same good old Honda...engine...controls, fit/finish...reliability
216	1437	What I was looking for to replace my durango
216	1438	Smaller but still has plenty of room, with good gas mileage
216	1439	I got the 4cyl it has plenty of pep and getting 25mpg after a month.
217	1440	I looked at the Tacoma, but didn't like the pricing (had to add a whole package just to get keyless entry, another package to get tow wiring, etc)
217	1441	The Ridgeline has it all, standard
217	1442	I really like the trunk and the way the rear seats flip up for storage
217	1443	There are many small intelligent things: the heater doesn't blow cold air on you (it waits until the car has warmed up before blowing any air), the driver's window has auto-down AND auto-up, you can lower all four windows with the key fob (great for airing out hot air), and the car gives you your real-time mpg as you drive
217	1444	It's fun, well-designed, and with Honda reliability too.
218	1445	This is the first vehicle I've owned in 30+ years that makes me want to drive
218	1446	It's no sports car but it's still a hoot! On decent roads the engine smoothly hums along and the car is quieter than my 2000 Accord
218	1447	The noise level does pick up when the engine is pushed but it seems willing enough and the transmission shifts with precision
218	1448	It rides very nicely on good roads but things get somewhat choppy on rougher surfaces
218	1449	However, the car remains very composed on all surfaces and is very easy to handle
218	1450	Gas mileage in lows 30s around town and low 40s on highway
218	1451	A lot of thought went into this design!
219	1452	I bought this 2009 Lancer GTS Automatic
219	1453	First, for what you are paying, this car is truly incredible
219	1454	I've research the others and read other reviews, the reviews speak for this car
219	1455	I traded my 06 corolla in for it and will never own another 'yota after this car
219	1456	For approx
219	1457	$17200 out the door I got this car loaded and for what I paid, blows the competition out the door
219	1458	I drove easy on my way home from the dealership and averaged 32.1 MPG, going about 60-70 MPH, not bad at all, I drive easy however
219	1459	All I can say is, Mitsubishi, awesome job
220	1460	Moved up from a Mazda3, and am very impressed with how smooth and quiet the car is
220	1461	Exterior styling is edgy without being too trendy and should hold up well over the years
220	1462	Interior styling is simple and elegant, and mostly very high quality (but what's up with the thin vinyl on the armrest and the Buick velour on the door panels??)
220	1463	On a 500 mile trip I averaged 34mpg in mostly rural driving at 60-65mph with a good bit of stop- and-go intown driving, and have been averaging about 27mpg around town
220	1464	Pretty awesome for such a big car
220	1465	I love that the car looks big, but drives like a much smaller car
220	1466	The ride is firm, but very compliant, a near perfect balance of handling and ride comfort
221	1467	I bought a Black 09' Pontiac G8 GT and could not be happier
221	1468	I have been to the gas station a couple times and people come right up to me asking me all about the car
221	1469	I too love when stopping at red lights and having the car rattle slightly from the V8 anxiously waiting to go
221	1470	I smile every time I go on a drive and glad this was the first new car I have purchased
222	1471	Its a good car for the price I haven't owned it very long so I cant say much but its turning out to be a fun little car 
223	1472	Bought as a daily driver to work and back
223	1473	After 4000 miles it has become a great car to own
223	1474	This car replaced my 1998 Taurus
223	1475	With a V6 I average 29-30 miles to the gallon, if using 10% ethanol blended gas then 26-27
223	1476	0% for 72 and invoice pricing made it a great deal
224	1477	I had been considering the Mustang, Challenger, or Camaro for a new sports car
224	1478	I needed a rear seat for my child (unless I could leave the wife home more often)
224	1479	After doing much research on all the vehicles and test-driving the challenger and Mustang
224	1480	I decided on the Mustang
224	1481	Tried the Challenger RT and it was ok but just didn?t do it for me
224	1482	I liked the outside of the new Camaro but didn?t like the inside so much
224	1483	Everything I researched also swayed me away from a first year production model on any vehicle as well
224	1484	Granted the ?tested? numbers show the Camaro going slightly faster than the Mustang I;m not concerned
224	1485	The mustang is just great all around
224	1486	No regrets at all!
225	1487	I love this car it has it all, Comfort Looks and Performance! Great Gas Mileage
225	1488	No complaints.
226	1489	I've only had my Scion XB for a week, but I just love the way it handles making turns, sitting in it is so comfortable, gas mileage is very good
226	1490	It has so much room
226	1491	It drives so smooth that I have to watch my speed because I don't realize that I'm going that fast
226	1492	The drivers door arm rest could be a little higher but that isn't a big deal
226	1493	Definitely would recommend it.
227	1494	Amazing value
227	1495	I've owned a 911Cab, 535i, SL55AMG and CL500 in the past 5 years
227	1496	Ridiculous yes but I like cars
227	1497	None of these come close to my new loaded '09 A5 for the dollar
227	1498	Yes, the SL55 had the power & torque but not the value or the back seat for kids
227	1499	I also drove the S5 but glad I bought the A5 instead with drive select
227	1500	Sometimes I want the 911 handling and other times the Lexus sofa
227	1501	With DriveSelect, its your decsion and it all works! I predict MB, BMW and Lexus will lose market share to Audi over the next few years and rightfully so
227	1502	"""Car of the Year"" ...if you can find one."
228	1503	I picked the 2.4L base automatic over several other models.I have 7000 miles on it.I have had several issues with it the center caps kept coming off,the steering column had a noise in it when it hit a bump
228	1504	The dealership found the electronic box on the bottom of steering wheel is bad and now the dashboard pieces that were taken off will not snap together
228	1505	The plastic clips seem to be very brittle they break off easy
228	1506	The XM radio is great as long as you don't go through mountains or valleys or even under shade trees signal will go out.The 2.4 has lot of power would not recommend 1.8
228	1507	I've been averaging 26 mpg city 35 mpg
228	1508	highway
228	1509	The wheels make car stand out.
229	1510	I am still breaking in the car with only 120 miles driven
229	1511	I am impressed by the engine and DSG transmission
229	1512	Very smooth shifts while accelerating, and seems to find the correct gear for each situation
229	1513	However,at very low speeds there is too much engine braking due to no fluid coupling so some small amount of lurching is sensed
229	1514	The interior is very attractive and seems well made
229	1515	The only complaint thus far is the front seats which are too hard
229	1516	I hear this is a German car trait, but this doesn't impress my behind
230	1517	I had this Pilot for almost 2 months now and have put in about 3,500 miles including California trip for Christmas
230	1518	Kids love the Rear Seat Entertainment, iPod connection and awesome sound system
230	1519	It is very nimble and fun to drive and better gas mileage than my 2004 Toyota Sequoia
230	1520	"I got the ""show vehicle"" so it came loaded with accessories including running boards, front & back aluminum cover and the front grille is upgraded & shiny"
230	1521	"Since my Pilot is loaded, it is a ""looker"""
230	1522	The grille actually looked more like an HDMI than a USB port as observed by others
230	1523	So, there you go, a High Definition SUV.
231	1524	 Love the Genesis,I had the car for one week the car is a good value for the money
231	1525	I had an Lexus GS, which was an better ride but the sound system was not as good as Genesis.On rough roads the ride is not stable I have Black/Black wtih Tech package,had the window tinted and the car came with the Wing package.Several people asked what it was
231	1526	With only 240 miles the fuel economy is unknown.
232	1527	I really like the dashboard layout
232	1528	Having the digital speedometer on the second tier, I would actually consider a safety feature
232	1529	It allows me to keep my eyes more on the road, by not having to look down as far to see my speed
232	1530	I love the black seating in the LX-S, but as others have stated, it does attract the lint
232	1531	Really love the gas mileage and the handling
232	1532	It has the typical Honda suspension that you feel the road bumps and hear the road noise
232	1533	It is fun to drive
232	1534	Great visibility all around
233	1535	Car so far has been pretty awesome
233	1536	Vehicle drives smoothly and I receive many compliments
233	1537	I have to say overall I am very satisfied with the car
233	1538	It has hot heat and cold a/c
233	1539	Test drove many other cars for many months and feel in love with this one
233	1540	Really love the placement on the digital speedometer
233	1541	Has a pretty decent sounds system, get about 37 mpg on the highway and 23 in the city
234	1542	I purchased a new saturn aura xe on April 30th
234	1543	On Aug 6 vehicle had to be towed as to transmission problem
234	1544	"Vehicle returned as ""repaired"" on Aug 7 and had to towed again on the 7th"
234	1545	Saturn Corp over the next 32 days literally lied about what the problem was and when the repair would be completed
234	1546	First they said the part was coming from Germany
234	1547	Then they couldn't locate the part
234	1548	"After numerous calls, we learned that the Dealership that was to make the repairs had given up their Saturn line and switched to Mazda and couldn't repair our vehicle even if they received the ""part"""
234	1549	Saturn Corp lied from the start
234	1550	Doing the right thing from day one, Ha Ha Ha 
235	1551	I purchased a new SEL with two options (ABS/ESC and Auto Tranny)
235	1552	I now have 3000 miles on the odometer and the car has performed flawlessly
235	1553	Gas mileage has been good - 35 mph and getting better
235	1554	I bought this car as a daily commuter, putting on 75 miles per day and in this regard, it has been ideal
235	1555	I looked at Madza 3 and the Mini Cooper, but the price-point and simplicity of the Focus appealed to me
235	1556	Also, having rented many small cars, I have had better-than-average experiences with the Focus
235	1557	Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and would do it again.
236	1558	This car delivers exactly what it is marketed to do
236	1559	It provides a very smooth ride with all of the practical needs
236	1560	I am still on my first tank of gas, and I am wondering if we will ever need to fill up
236	1561	It is extremely quiet
236	1562	You can hardly tell if the car is running
236	1563	I almost turned the key to try and start it again because I could not hear the engine
237	1564	I had previously owned an A4 (2000)
237	1565	I remembered the fun it brought, so I thought I'd give it another chance when I began my car search
237	1566	I also tried all the usual suspects
237	1567	This was simply the best bang for the buck
237	1568	I went with the Premium package with AWD
237	1569	You don't need anything more than that
237	1570	I read many reviews by other readers and I agree with the positive vibe on this newly improved model.
238	1571	I bought XT Limited this primarily for my wife, who had been nursing along a 2001 Jeep Cherokee Laredo with 130K+ miles
238	1572	The new Subie is a pleasant driving experience! The turbo provides a distinct but not overpowering reminder that this Forester is no longer a narcoleptic Sunday drive with Aunt Millie and Uncle Olaf
238	1573	Plenty of room
238	1574	I'm 6-2, and there's still headroom
238	1575	Our 2 boys like the moon-roof
238	1576	"The 09 Forester is wider, longer, and taller, making it larger than other ""small"" SUVs, and very close to what I expect from mid-SUVs I have to laugh - the coffee-cup holder is still flimsy and cheap looking - just like in all Subarus, including our '99 Sub Outback wagon"
239	1577	I have had this vehicle for three months now and have had it on two long roadtrips
239	1578	I get better gas mileage then posted
239	1579	It is well built and very reliable
239	1580	I have tried the safety features with almost getting in accidents while driving through Montreal Quebec of which were not my fault
239	1581	I have owned 4 Chrysler Vehicles and have had no problems with any of them
239	1582	If people would slow down and actually do the posted speed limit then maybe they would see better gas mileage
239	1583	Everybody thinks that driving is a right, WELL IT'S NOT
239	1584	Keep up the good work Dodge.
240	1585	The 2009 Acura TL AWD is a fantastic car
240	1586	It was well-built inside and out
240	1587	I previously leased a Lexus ES 350 and the driving was night and day compared to this TL
240	1588	I am one of those who love the look of the TL and appreciate the boldness of the Acura design team
240	1589	In my opinion, the TL is a wonderful bang for the buck
240	1590	Where else can you find a comparable car with all the driving and technological capabilities for less than $40,000?
241	1591	 I have driven both this model and the one it replaces and it seems the quality does down while the usability goes up
241	1592	This is one of the worst cars I have ever driven and am ashamed to call it an American car
241	1593	Chrysler should really think about doing the honorable thing and just putting itself (and our taxes) out of it misery
241	1594	Drive quality = F, Confort = F Build = F
241	1595	The plastic on the inside likes like it was spray painted with cheap rattle can paint and it chips off with a light fingernail
241	1596	you need a phd to get the top down, the heater is too hot or too cold
241	1597	the seats are terrible and there is no back seat
241	1598	Don't buy this car
242	1599	Went from a 2007 Durango Limited to the 2009 xB
242	1600	We went from 14 mpg to 28 mpg (although to give the Durango credit
242	1601	Yeah..it has a HEMI!
242	1602	"We weren't sure if we would like something as small as the xB with both of us being ""real"" sized people"
242	1603	The xB has a lot of room inside and is very comfortable
242	1604	We have had it for about 2 months and have had no problems at all
242	1605	It is surprisingly peppy for a 4 cyl and handles great!
243	1606	I have read other reviews here and I have to say that most of the complaints about the Journey are just absurd and elementary
243	1607	Most all brands have plastic interiors,power wise this is not a sports car,we are consistently getting 18mpg in town and 25mpg highway
243	1608	As far as transmission problems,we have have not experienced any,but that's not to say there aren't a few
243	1609	As I drive around town I can't help notice all of the well marked courtesy vehicles from Mercedes, BMW,Acura and Lexus
243	1610	Why do your think they are out there? Its not because they are getting an oil change! Most All brands have issues & recalls
243	1611	We have the SXT model
243	1612	Overall we feel the Journey is a fantastic value for the money.
244	1613	I have had my car 3 days
244	1614	What a wonderful car
244	1615	White Satin Pearl with Beige leather interior.This car is a beauty with great technology
244	1616	Form and function at the highest level
244	1617	Can't comment on mileage or reliability as it only 3 days old
244	1618	I'm still going thru the manuals(they are excellent).
245	1619	This was my first American car purchase in over 15-years
245	1620	I tested the Malibu versus the Acura TSX, Camry and Accord
245	1621	There was no comparison
245	1622	In addition to being a great value, the luxury car-like styling, comfort, quiet ride, interior room and taut suspension closed the deal
245	1623	With this car, GM is (finally) world class
246	1624	I bought my new TSX over labor day, trading in both a leased '05 RL and a Mazda 3 wagon
246	1625	I was a hair's breadth away from buying a V6 Accord, but decided to go for the extra bells and whistles of the TSX
246	1626	Someone told me I'd just bought a $32,000 iPod accessory (which may have a grain of truth)
246	1627	While I think the car has plenty of power, and I love the gas mileage, the poor little engine thrashes and complains under even moderate load
246	1628	I took it to the dealer complaining that the engine was knocking (it was really that bad!), but they said to just use Shell or Chevron premium
246	1629	That didn't really help
246	1630	I expected better from Honda.
247	1631	I've so far owned two 2009 Tacoma Trucks
247	1632	An offroad model and a sport model
247	1633	The offroad was totaled and I replaced with the sport model
247	1634	Overall I like the truck and it's a keeper, nice acceleration, quality interior vs the competition, safety features are great - ie
247	1635	my airbags worked on impact, and the frame crumpled and distributed the impact force properly where my cabin area stayed intact
247	1636	However, I won't buy another 6 to 10 yrs down the road unless Toyota can fix the rough ride, the spongy brakes, and improve the fuel economy by at least 2 MPG for the 4X4 model.
248	1637	I am quite pleased with this truck
248	1638	I was open minded towards purchasing any brand and type of truck
248	1639	I chose the Frontier for several reasons: Good build quality; metal where you normally see plastic and good fit
248	1640	Smoothest shifting I've ever seen, especially into and out of 4WD
248	1641	Name brand tires
248	1642	Power; (V6) plenty of it with decent fuel economy
248	1643	Not too big, not too small; perfect size for someone who doesn't live in their truck
248	1644	Drives very well; confident handling and feel
248	1645	Overall great truck I think
248	1646	Assembled in USA
248	1647	Don't be fooled, you can't have someone in the back for any long period of time in King Cab but I'm ok with that
248	1648	Oil filter a little hard to get to
249	1649	We had a Ford Edge and we loved it , This vehicle is more expensive but the ride and interior are superior.The 0% financing is great.
250	1650	So I just got my package 6 Prius two weeks ago and love it! I traded in my BMW Z4 for it so I was really worried about it not having enough power since that was what I was used to but I am pleasantly surprised
250	1651	I have driven it a lot already, about 1,000 miles and have averaged 45.9 mpg mostly freeway
250	1652	It is extremely smooth, leather is much nicer then I thought and the keyless go, JBL, navi, back up camera and bluetooth are all amazing! 
251	1653	I have done alot of research before I got this car
251	1654	When Chevy brought out the new Malibu in 08', I knew I had to have one
251	1655	I love my car, I got the 2lt with the engine package, so fuel economy is not that great, but it is so fun to drive
251	1656	I plan on driving it to Arizona all the time from Vegas, it is so comfortable too, GM did a great job with this car
251	1657	I bought it because it has done so well in the first year.
252	1658	We've owned over 30 cars/trucks over the years what with ourselves and a family of young drivers
252	1659	We owned Nissan, Toyota, Renault, Chevrolet, Pontiac, Dodge, Plymouth, Mitsubishi, and a few more
252	1660	We had a nice Toyota Sienna mini van, and the last we bought in a foreign brand
252	1661	It had it's problems
252	1662	But we still shopped and drove a Toyota Camry, Mazda 6, and Saab 9-3
252	1663	We really liked the Mazda and Saab
252	1664	The Camry didn't seem as great a car as it has been talked up
252	1665	Plus the price even with low interest
252	1666	The Saturn Aura XR-4 won hands down for price, features, safety, and fuel efficiency
252	1667	We got an Aura XR-4, 6 speed automatic 
253	1668	Best small SUV, Rav4 is easy to park, fun to drive, nice interior I loved the trunk space.
254	1669	Love this car! I owned the first G35 coupe back in 2003 and traded it in 2006 for Lexus IS and missed the G every day until I bought my 2009 G37 Journey coupe the other day
254	1670	Feels great to drive a real high performance car again.
255	1671	Trade in my 1996 Chev Blazer with over 230,000 miles
255	1672	Thank you for the $$$ for clunkers
255	1673	I'm very happy with this auto
255	1674	My 1st time in a Mini Van
255	1675	The kids love it
255	1676	lots of room for other friends and family
255	1677	Just the radio acts up time to time
256	1678	I bought the CC 4cyclinder 2.0 model about 3-weeks ago
256	1679	I enjoy the attention the car gets and the sleek look
256	1680	One major drawback is the car doesn't absorb bumps well and it's not a comfortable ride at all
256	1681	I have not read about any suspension problems
256	1682	Feel trapped in a beautiful car with a not so comfortable ride
256	1683	Also, the gas mileage is so good
256	1684	Not getting 20 mpg at all
256	1685	Backing up is a nightmare
257	1686	I finally bought this car after reading reviews and staring at pictures of it over a course of 2 years and it's precisely the car I wanted
257	1687	Coming from a 2003 basic model of a Saturn Ion it's a huge upgrade and great for someone my age (22).
258	1688	Long story short: I leased my Volkswagen EOS April1, 2009
258	1689	Today is August 3, 2009 and it's been in the shop 3 times (STILL THERE mind you) for the convertable top malfunctioning OVER AND OVER AND OVER again
258	1690	It stopped mid-air in a parking lot and wouldn't open all the way OR close all the way! I had to get a Flat Bed to take it to the dealership! Now VW wants to replace the ENTIRE roof! It's 3 MONTHS OLD! And, this is the best part, they are telling me that I MAY HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS
258	1691	It's $8,000 alone just for the top! I am PETRIFIED to drive this car anymore and I don't want it anymore
258	1692	The aggravation I have been through is appalling
258	1693	It's STILL in the shop for the rest of summer!!!
259	1694	Prior to this car, I had a Rav4 which I liked
259	1695	Then My wife bought an Avalon and after one drive, I had trouble enjoying the Rav anymore! I decided it was time for a new ride, but another Avalon didn't make sense because I have a bad back and it is hard for me to get in and out
259	1696	I wanted something with a ride height similar to a Rav, and the luxury of the Avalon
259	1697	As soon as I sat in the Venza, I knew it was what I was looking for
259	1698	The test drive sealed the deal
259	1699	It has the same 6 cyl as the Avalon, which I really like, and AWD which I insist on with all my cars
259	1700	"The interior is huge, and the ride is as good as the Camry even with the 20"" wheels"
259	1701	The 6 speed trans is silky smooth
260	1702	Overall a great car
260	1703	This is my second Infiniti, first being the g35
260	1704	This is a big step forward
260	1705	The car is beautiful both in and out
260	1706	Very comfortable and fun to drive
260	1707	I looked at this as well as the BMW 335i and walked away with this car mostly based on price
260	1708	Being nit picky, I will say that the car needs just a little more refinement in the brakes and engine department
260	1709	The brakes are very touchy
260	1710	not too smooth
260	1711	The engine is great but you feel the shifts too much
260	1712	There is also a good 2 to 2.5 second delay between pedal mash and power to the wheels at highway speed.
261	1713	Best purchase for the times
261	1714	Have and X5 and 5 series
261	1715	The Camry has brought daily sanity back to driving what with European Style gas prices
261	1716	I have cut almost $400 dollars per month in my monthly fuel bill
261	1717	Plus the environment suffers less
261	1718	The Camry is comfortable but not too much like a boat
261	1719	A great daily driver
261	1720	I don't miss my other cars at all.
262	1721	My wife and I purchased the Elantra out of desperation because it was the last day of the Clunkers program, most dealers in our area had already stopped accepting trade-ins and our 89 BMW 735i was falling apart We test drove the Jetta, Civic, Sentra and Corolla but purchased the Elantra blindly because we really had no other choice as all dealer's inventories were fully depleted
262	1722	WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE THE ELANTRA HAS BEEN! The car is solid
262	1723	The ride, instrumentation, handling, braking, feel etc
262	1724	are all terrific
262	1725	I had and image in my mind of Hyundai's being cheap and raggedy, boy was I wrong
262	1726	We live Chicago, the Pothole Capital of the World and this car easily holds it's own.
263	1727	"forget the ""policy"" of no saturn discounts"
263	1728	i got $2,750 off list, plus was allowed to use $2,000 in GM credit card rewards
263	1729	this turned a $26,933 car into about a $22,000 car
263	1730	Moroccan leather interior and sunroof included
263	1731	Classy - very classy
264	1732	Purchased car to support American economy and ingenuity after 25 years of foreign purchases
264	1733	Found that the car has hidden flaws
264	1734	Rear side panels become detached by a slight push inward
264	1735	Took it back to dealer and I was told it was designed to come apart at impact
264	1736	Cannot believe engineers would think this way after decades of safety improvements
264	1737	The dealer also found out the most of its other Malibus on the lot had the same defect
264	1738	I am very dissapointed, especially after what I had heard about the vehicle
264	1739	"I am very hesitant to buy ""American"" again, especially after the local dealer has been very deceptive after discovery of this problem"
265	1740	We just picked up the '09 6 GT to replace a leased Ford; all around, it's better/more fun to drive than our '08 Accord
265	1741	A quieter ride, more surefooted feel, nice build quality, great looks/lighting, etc
265	1742	Love the Bluetooth and BMS, along with the advanced keyless system
265	1743	Very satisfied.
266	1744	Ride: Have driven on I76, I80, I 90, I190, I78, I70, I86, Route 22 central PA and really it's all smooth drive except for some bumps on I 86
266	1745	Pickup: Good
266	1746	Did well on the ups and downs of the Alleghenies
266	1747	Noise: I contradict on the critics comments on the wind & road noise- Driving at 65mph and can hear the crisp and crystal clear music at level 6-7 maybe the premium JBL system (std on venza) is the performer
266	1748	Engine & Mileage: V6 is powerful but fuel efficient
266	1749	Driving between 50 mph-65 mph highway will give an avg fuel consumption of 27-29 mpg..
266	1750	"isn't it wonderful!!! Tire: noise is also very low (have 20"" Michelin)"
266	1751	Seats: Leather seats are comfortable for a 4-5 hour dive at a stretch.
267	1752	I looked at Toyota Corolla S which is slightly cheaper than this Honda Civic LX
267	1753	Honda civic provide a better grip on the road and fun to drive
267	1754	I have the car for almost two months and I averaged like 30 miles per gallon on both city and highway
267	1755	Very agile and preppy comparable to my Acura Integra
267	1756	I love the double cluster gauge specially when you are cruising
267	1757	It gives you the exact mileage
267	1758	The least favorites are the following: 1) No trunk remote release for this model
267	1759	2) The plastic are easily marked
267	1760	3) 40/60 split on the rear seats
267	1761	Now is the best time to buy a Honda for you can get more than 1,000 off the MRSP price of this car
268	1762	Went from a Honda civic, so naturally am impressed with the handling of this well made auto
268	1763	It has plenty of power, with excellent cornering and braking
268	1764	Everyone in the family says it makes me look younger!
269	1765	I've had my Civic for about 2 months now and I really enjoy it
269	1766	I did a lot of research prior to purchasing this vehicle and it has lived up to almost everything I heard/read
269	1767	I love both the interior and exterior styling -- the two tier dash is my favorite
269	1768	The quality of the interior materials is far beyond that of some of its competitors, namely the Toyota Corolla
269	1769	I read some other reviews that complained about the lack of a remote trunk release, 60/40 rear split seats, and outside temperature gauge: All of these features are available on the EX trim
269	1770	My only complaint is the gas mileage...I average about 27 mpg
269	1771	Based on my research, I was expecting better fuel economy.
270	1772	I looked for the right combination of sportiness, fun to drive and family friendly for 2 years
270	1773	The Honda Accord coupe appealed to me
270	1774	The kids did not fare well in the back
270	1775	Nissan was so arrogant they would not let me have a test drive without a deposit
270	1776	I loved the mini
270	1777	My tallest in class kids are not likely to fit in the back for long
270	1778	Alas, sporty moms have an option
270	1779	The kids love the new car
270	1780	Their sports car crazed mom, who raced motorcycles, is happy too
270	1781	It reminds me of my Honda S2000, with room for the kids
270	1782	Who said moms are delegated to the slow lane? Cool mom, cool car
271	1783	Just purchased my first Kia and my first new car ever, drove it off the lot with 40 miles on the clock
271	1784	I now have just over 1,000 miles on the car over the last 3 weeks
271	1785	The car has mostly been used for city driving, my 35 mile R/T drive to work
271	1786	So far I am very happy with the car
271	1787	The gas mileage has been around 28 MPG in the city, but I do expect that to increase as the car continues to break in
271	1788	One of the major selling points for me was the incredible warranty and the roadside assistance
271	1789	The interior is a bit spartan but very well thought out
271	1790	I love all the storage compartments in the car
271	1791	The stereo is not bad for a stock system and I love my sunroof
272	1792	I picked up my new TDI Loyalty Edition last week after waiting about 2 months for it and have driven it about 350 miles so far and I absolutely love the handling and torque
272	1793	So far I am doubtful that I will see the 45+ mpg I was hoping for, unless it improves after it is broken in
272	1794	I have been avg about 35 mpg combo city/hwy
272	1795	I have been driving a little aggressively, so maybe there is some upside
272	1796	I do like the car and it handle very well for a sedan
272	1797	Great value and economy
272	1798	Here's hoping for better mileage! 
273	1799	This is my third Honda, and all have been amazingly reliable
273	1800	Not all of them have been fun to drive, however
273	1801	My new Si takes the fun level off the scale compared to most other Hondas
273	1802	Are there faster cars? Yes
273	1803	Are there better handling cars? Yes
273	1804	Can you get any of these other cars for under $19,200? No chance
273	1805	The closest car that I found would have been almost $6000 more than the Civic
273	1806	It's an amazing car for the money
273	1807	Be careful when reading other reviews, as most of the people driving the Civic Si are younger drivers
273	1808	The one reviewer complaining about a vibration in the brakes is describing the activation of the ABS system
273	1809	Without it he would have been in a skid.
274	1810	This is one nice car!! Very quiet with and excellent radio
274	1811	Controls can be a little confusing until you know where all the controls are
274	1812	It's best to practice a little before you go on the road and want to change radio channels or map functions
274	1813	I get a lot of AHHHs from my co-workers when they look at the interior styling
274	1814	I bought a bright silver exterior
274	1815	"The prominent ""transformer shield"" grill blends in nicely"
274	1816	Not so with darker colors, in my opinion
274	1817	The tail end looks fabulous!! Definite BMW 7 series resemblances
274	1818	Very powerful acceleration
274	1819	Great control over rainy roads with the SH-AWD
274	1820	Gas mileage isn't great, but it's not bad either
274	1821	On par with a 300 hp car that's 4,000 lbs.
275	1822	Very pleased with my purchase, and happy I opted to go for the extras on the SE model
275	1823	I find the engine to be quite capable and powerful for both city and highway driving
275	1824	The car feels well grounded and handles well
275	1825	Nicely designed inside and out, it returns quite a bang for the buck in regards to all the features, in my opinion.
276	1826	My 09 SEL has only been home 2 days
276	1827	I must say going from the Touareg to the Tiquan was a step down for me
276	1828	But the cost of gas plus the 1800 brake job on the Touareg made up my mind quick
276	1829	I think dealers should disclose the high cost of maintenance
276	1830	You can rest assured I checked out the cost to replace brakes on the Tig! I love all the features! Opted not to have the nav sys
276	1831	Rather use my phone nav
276	1832	Have everything else
276	1833	With the limited supply and end-of-year incentives (they were gr8), had to settle for the blue-pretty though
276	1834	The only down side I experienced was the negotiation at the dealer! I HATE that part of purchasing a car! Otherwise, I am happy so far! Happy Drivin VW Folk!
277	1835	Traded my 08 Accord EX in on 09 Max SV and have had it for about three weeks and 1000 miles and wow what and upgrade, I cannot believe how nice this car is, the Accord isn't even in the same league
277	1836	The performance is unbelievable, this thing is a rocket, ride is very quite, interior materials are very classy, seats are comfortable, good handling with the 18in wheels, and I am averaging 23.5 in mixed driving which I considering pretty good
277	1837	I have gotten tons of compliments on the looks from neighbors to complete strangers
277	1838	I still haven't figured out all of the gadgets but this thing has lots of goodies
277	1839	I would highly recommend buying one
277	1840	You won't be disappointed.
278	1841	Disappointed, engine stalls
278	1842	Also prone to flooding if you drive it for less than 40 minutes - not good news with inner city living needing you to shuffle parking spots
278	1843	The final nail was a dropped rotor
278	1844	"Reported the performance drop off to Mazda, they ""didn't find anything"""
278	1845	Needed a full engine replacement, never again ..
278	1846	"and then Mazda Australia comment of ""no customer goodwill will be provided"""
278	1847	Sure could try the legal route, but have not got the time.
279	1848	Gave up my Acura TL after 7 great years
279	1849	"Was a little worried about ""trading down"" to Honda, but I couldn't be happier"
279	1850	Was looking for a commuter car, & this definitely fits the bill
279	1851	It's very well built, nice interior, and easily fits 4 people (5 might be cozy, we haven't tried it yet)
279	1852	While not the most powerful car, it delivers what it needs to in most situations
279	1853	It's quite loud around 3- 4K RPM (going up steep hills)
279	1854	But by far the best feature - 42MPG, as advertised
279	1855	Got 51MPG today on a 74 mile drive
279	1856	I don't mind sitting at stop lights as much anymore, since the car shuts off
279	1857	"It does lack in some ""luxury"" things (push button start, HID, etc), but for 22K, can't complain"
279	1858	Great car.
280	1859	I saw the Enclave about a year ago and started my research immediately
280	1860	Compared to all the other sport looking crossovers, with a three pass third row seat, the Buick has the most standard features at a better or comparable price point
280	1861	I had a Tahoe, and I loved it, except for the cargo behind the third row, I couldn't even fit a standard stroller back there, so this time I was looking for the passenger room and functionality, and I found it
280	1862	My kids can easily access the third row
280	1863	It has all the pretty things that I wanted, to include the dual sun roofs and power liftgate
280	1864	It looks hot, drives like a dream, and made all my friends jealous! And, you can't beat the warranty! Thanks!
281	1865	Since buying this vehicle I can't seem to want to park it
281	1866	The feel on the road,acceleration and overall experience is fantastic
281	1867	I love this vehicle
281	1868	It's the nicest car I test drove and believe me I tested them all before the purchase 
282	1869	"Brakes squeak from day one, transmission makes shredding, tearing noises when putting in reverse and then drive, headrest forces your head forward, when full gas tank sounds like a swimming pool sloshing around and already had a safety recall for poor build quality with ""noises"" coming from the back of the car"
282	1870	Road noise is horrible on certain roads
282	1871	You still want to risk buying this car?? My last Honda ever! 
283	1872	I drove the the Camry and Accord when shopping--the Sonata has a much more comfortable ride
283	1873	When pulling up to red lights next to Sonata's competitors, I find myself feeling sorry for them that they settled for less
283	1874	The Sonata is really well thought out in terms of design
283	1875	I couldn't be happier
283	1876	Thank you Hyundai engineers and designers
283	1877	My daughter bought one just six days after I bought mine--different color of course
283	1878	She loves hers too.
284	1879	Just had the car for 3 days and I really enjoy driving it
284	1880	After months of searching for a new vehicle my husband and I finally decided on a new xB
284	1881	The price and being made by Toyota is what sold us
284	1882	We got the fog lamps, rear fin, upgraded wheels, in the new stingray metal
285	1883	Great ride, very comfortable and quiet
285	1884	Got the 5.4 engine as I got a great deal on an advertised package, and the mileage only 1 mpg less
285	1885	Getting about 14 mpg in the city, about the same as my old 97 f150 4.7 v- 8
285	1886	I noticed in consumer reports, they mentioned the truck engine to be a little loud, and the ride a little rough
285	1887	Wow, I would have to disagree
285	1888	This engine and tranny is silky smooth and quiet, everyone comments on that who has been in the truck
285	1889	I test drove some other trucks, but this one really feels luxurious.
286	1890	This car has the absolute WORST driveability of any car that I have recently driven
286	1891	This purchase is a HUGE MISTAKE and I have nothing but REGRETS!!
286	1892	It DOES NOT GO IN STRAIGHT LINE ON THE HIGHWAY!!!!!! It needs CONSTANT, and I mean CONSTANT, steering corrections to keep it going straight ahead
286	1893	So your arms get EXTREMELY tired in a very short time (And yes, I've checked the alignment SEVERAL times)
286	1894	I had a friend's 2000 Geo Metro Hatchback for a couple months last year, and that car tracked waaaayy better (and that's a $1000 car for crying out loud!!!!!!!)
286	1895	It is impossible to take this car on anything more than a half hour drive without feeling your arms are going to fall off!!!
287	1896	Had a 3.0 X5
287	1897	Test drove Audi, Lexus, Acura, BMW gas, and fell for performance of X5 diesel
287	1898	After 7,000 miles I am actually trading it in for MB ML350 diesel
287	1899	BMW just not as comfortable
287	1900	Seats not as supportive
287	1901	Engine can be too loud
287	1902	Satellite radio comes & goes
287	1903	Passenger seat grinds/clicks when moved
287	1904	Steering wheel squeaks when moved
287	1905	Rt side speakers go dead on iPod integration
287	1906	Need to roll the window up/down a few times to get speakers back
287	1907	Steering wheel does not telescope long enough for 6-1 height
287	1908	Engine performance is incredible
287	1909	Second seat leg room is great
287	1910	Cargo space is great
287	1911	Just want more refinement
287	1912	Maybe I am getting old.
288	1913	Great car
288	1914	Excellent acceleration, braking and handling
288	1915	Sound system is awesome and looks are incredible.
289	1916	I've had my new TL for 2 weeks and am in love with it
289	1917	Traded in my 2007 G35x and do not miss it one bit
289	1918	interior is large and fit and finish is top notch
289	1919	reviews regarding steering are not accurate
289	1920	Steering is spot-on and effort is just right
289	1921	controls are intimidating at first but make perfect sense after a few days
289	1922	gas mileage is great for this class, and as far as the styling goes, even stubborn anti-car girlfriend loves it
290	1923	I have just over 8000 miles on my Taco and am very pleased with the truck
290	1924	Adequate power, comfortable ride, good looks and fun to drive.
291	1925	Had the car for 3 weeks now and am pleased with it
291	1926	I never considered buying a Elantra, but friends of ours has 2 and love them
291	1927	I wanted a car that's reliable, safe, good mpg,comfortable and affordable-the Elantra was it! No other car maker came close with the same options & price plus warranty
291	1928	It's not sporty or a head turner,but for me that's ok.
292	1929	I love my Sienna! My friends can't believe that I traded in my BMW M3 for a minivan
292	1930	Being a mom, family safety and comfort was at the forefront of my decision but I started to really like the aesthetics of the minivan
292	1931	I was surprised at the turn radius and also the pep
292	1932	I have to say that I cannot live without the remote sliding doors/trunk, AWD, DVD, and rear camera
292	1933	I've been trading in my old Siennas for a new one every 2 years or so because I love them so much (not because I've had any problems with them)
292	1934	I keep changing colors and haven't yet decided which is my favorite yet
292	1935	I love the AWD and run flat tires (makes me feel safer with the family on board).
293	1936	Traded our Acura TSX for an Audi Q5 and could not be happier with the choice
293	1937	The Audi Q5 does not handle like your normal SUV and it gives us better mileage so far in the City and on Highway driving with way more storage room than the Acura TSX and ability to haul more stuff
293	1938	I would certainly recommend this car to anyone looking for a smaller SUV, a lot of fun, power and style.
294	1939	After studying all the compact SUVs, we decided that the Rogue was just what we needed
294	1940	It had good mileage (for this class of vehicles) and, in fact, we are getting 26-27 in town and close to 30 on the road
294	1941	It has the clearance and AWD we needed for moderate off-the-road usage (wildlife surveys, kayak in-putting, etc.)
294	1942	In addition, it is very comfortable and quite quiet on the highway
294	1943	Handling is better than the other compact SUVs that we tested
294	1944	Reviewers complain about the storage capacity being less than some of the competitors, but we do not need it and appreciate the better looks and handling of the Rogue
294	1945	Bigger is not always better
294	1946	After 4 months and 5K miles, zero defects.
295	1947	We've owned it for over a month and had one long road trip
295	1948	"We've loaded it with 3 passengers and 18 2""x10"" four foot long boards along with a roll of fencing"
295	1949	We love the capacity and functionality of it
295	1950	It was comfortable on the trip
295	1951	Gas mileage was decent, but a 5 speed auto would be great
295	1952	We've been getting ~26mpg and that's mostly around town including a carpool line
295	1953	Considering it is a compact car, it's a great car for a small family
295	1954	We got the premium package and the ride isn't very bumpy
295	1955	We also haven't found the steering to be vague as mentioned in some reviews.
296	1956	I bought the 09 Frontier back in August of 08 and since then I have put 23,000 miles on it so far
296	1957	It gets really good gas mileage for it's engine size I average about 18 or 19 basicly I fill up when it gets to 1/4 tank and I have driven about 325 miles
296	1958	It's really smooth on the highway and offroad the handling is second to none
296	1959	The hill descent feature and hill start assist are really great options to have esp in the winter with snowy conditions
296	1960	Overall just a great truck that can fit four people comfortably on long trips.
297	1961	This has become a love hate relationship
297	1962	My wife and I are car lovers, we have a LARGER number ranging from the smart to several high performance sport cars
297	1963	We live in a semi-rural area
297	1964	Size doesn't matter
297	1965	But I do like the nimbleness of our smart and ease of driving
297	1966	The quirks of the car can get to you
297	1967	Forget the gearbox, much has been written, but how about the rear hatch
297	1968	What kind of a computer does it have that it take 10 seconds to release
297	1969	Why is there no beep confirmation when locking and unlocking doors
297	1970	Maintenance! I am a little of a do it yourselfer....go check the water in the battery
297	1971	It's a joke
297	1972	Many in dealer stock
297	1973	Bloom is off
298	1974	This is my second xterra, my first was a 2000 SE purchased in 99'
298	1975	There is no other suv out at the moment that I would rather have (excluding the larger BMW X's and infinity QX56)
298	1976	My 2000 only gave me a fuel pump problem (replaced by dealer on a recall) in 100,000 of driving, with very bad maintenance record after the 2nd year, changed oil every other year
298	1977	So I figured I pushed it to the max (last day came back from the jersey shore at avg.80MPH and it was time to get a new one
298	1978	I love my 2009 off road - the sound system is awsome
298	1979	The truck, well I'll just let it speak for itself
298	1980	now if I can just pay this sucker off I would be the happiest man on the planet.
299	1981	A nice, solid car
299	1982	Enough power to hold it's own against the big guys
299	1983	The leather sport seats are very comfortable -- I did an 8 hour trip a couple of weeks ago, and could have easily done another couple of hours that day
299	1984	Average mileage has been 38 city / 43 highway
299	1985	I had the same windshield washer issue that JMS mentioned
299	1986	However I found that the nozzles are adjustable and was able to redirect the spray back to the windshield (as opposed to the roof of the car!)
300	1987	I tried to convince myself to buy a German SUV
300	1988	I test drove the X5 (3.0), Audi Q7, and the ML 350
300	1989	In my opinion none of the German cars come close to touching the MDX in handling, comfort and space
300	1990	Material could be a touch better in the MDX (the black fiberglass trim looks cheap for example)
300	1991	But there is no way I could justify 8-10K more for any of the German cars
300	1992	And don't get me started on the RX350 or the CX9
301	1993	After purchasing a 2009 Honda ex-l pilot I realize that the pre-wiring connection was a dummy connection
301	1994	I am not able to connect a trailer wiring harness unless I purchase the expensive kit from Honda
301	1995	The kit cost more than if I had bought the tow hitch separate and had it wired
301	1996	I also found out splicing into the wiring voids the warranty
301	1997	Then I learned that remote start is a problem
301	1998	Turning the car off after remote start just to enter the car is the dumbest idea I ever heard
301	1999	It is my understanding both of these feature was pre-figure to get you to come back to Honda
301	2000	I just wonder what else have Honda done to steer you back to them
301	2001	My first Honda and my last
301	2002	Bad mistake of Honda.
302	2003	Lease was up on my 2005 Highlander V6 Limited which I enjoyed
302	2004	Did a lot of homework on smaller SUVs since we are empty nesters now and always said I'd never go back to a car
302	2005	Test drove many SUVs then I test drove the Camry for the heck of it and I was sold
302	2006	Fits me like a glove
302	2007	Can't believe the smoothness and quiet cabin which is my #1 priority
302	2008	Had 2 Honda Accords years ago and thought they were the best cars I ever owned but I was wrong, this Camry surpasses any vehicle I've had
302	2009	Didn't take any adjusting from driving an SUV to a car which I thought I'd feel
302	2010	Gas mileage is excellent compared to the Highlander
302	2011	City 24.6
302	2012	Highway not sure yet
302	2013	Loving every aspect of this car!
303	2014	Pros: Body style is distinctive
303	2015	Standard DSC
303	2016	Roomy
303	2017	Quiet at highway speed
303	2018	Uncluttered dash controls
303	2019	Huge trunk
303	2020	Nice firm suspension
303	2021	You don't blend into the sea of Camcords in a parking lot
303	2022	Good combination of fuel efficiency, size, handling, and looks
303	2023	Base stereo far better than our Civic EX-L
303	2024	Cons: Front seats shaped weirdly, not the best comfort
303	2025	Steering wheel obscures top of gauges when adjusted properly
303	2026	Stupid red gauge lighting reminds me of wife's old junky pontiac grand-am
303	2027	Auto trans shifts in and out of overdrive too often
303	2028	Clear shifter surround panel scratches easily
303	2029	Little support from online forums, not nearly as much as VW or Honda message boards.
304	2030	Great car
304	2031	I have only had it 3 weeks but I am impressed (good)
304	2032	My other vehicle is F-150 V-8, but this little 4 banger (4 cyl) really has the power, I can't imagine a V-6 in this thing
304	2033	It only has about 870 miles so far but it really goes fast, I have to watch my speed to keep it under 70 mph
304	2034	We took the car over to the coast to break in the engine
304	2035	Up hill and down around sharp curves it was great, power was right there better than my F-150 V-8
304	2036	Gas mileage is outstanding..
304	2037	on our road trip to the coast and back, freeways at 70-80..
304	2038	my average is 28.1 mpg
304	2039	I could not believe it
304	2040	The only bad thing is the brakes
304	2041	You really have to push the brake pedal hard when coming to a stop sign
305	2042	Compared to Camry, Accord, Fusion, and Mazda6 before purchase
305	2043	Loved the features and styling by comparison
305	2044	Beautiful car, great looking/functional interior, lots of car for the money
305	2045	City mileage not as good as hoped, not the best visibility out because of high belt line and rear shelf, and transmission a little sluggish at times around town
305	2046	Otherwise very happy with purchase after 4 months.
306	2047	I think the positives of this vehicle have been covered pretty thoroughly to this point
306	2048	For me, it was this or a CRV, and the deal I received from VW just crushed what Honda was willing to do
306	2049	Sticker on my SE was 29,115
306	2050	Final purchase price was 25,604
306	2051	Both of the preceding figures are pretax
306	2052	I put $2000 down and financed the remainder @ 0% for 60 months
306	2053	Honda thought I was making stuff up, $3600 off MSRP plus 0% for 5 years
306	2054	VW is definitely trying to move inventory, I guess Honda isn't desperate enough yet
306	2055	I absolutely love the vehicle though, but I've only had it for a week so reliability is tough to judge at this point
306	2056	Absolutely zero buyer's remorse to this point.
307	2057	2009 ES in red and black interior - 2wd My wife loves this SUV
307	2058	Did not need extra stuff like 4wd or navigation or high end radio
307	2059	Handles great, good mpg, looks nice
307	2060	Rides very smooth on highway
307	2061	Radio works well, plenty space for five or six
307	2062	Tailgate is nice feature for loading and unloading
307	2063	Car feels and looks more expensive than is was
307	2064	Interior looks sharp
307	2065	10 year warranty.
308	2066	Got my 3.8 on 5/22 - and just returned from a 1,800 mile trip to S.C
308	2067	Despite getting into some horrendous traffic jams - the car still delivered over 25 mpg! Ride is quite smooth - but not perfect - especially on rough roads
308	2068	Beautiful and comfortable interior
308	2069	Whisper-quiet engine with lots of power
308	2070	(Can't understand why anyone would want the 8 cly.) I did not order the tech package, but bought a Garmin instead
308	2071	Unless you need frequent directions - this is the way to go
308	2072	My bluetooth cannot read my voice commands! Will make an appointment with dealer to fix.
309	2073	Luckily, my 12mpg Infiniti QX56 has been traded and this 2009 Acura TSX is the replacement! I just wish I bought one of these before
309	2074	"Great handling! Smooth and quiet! Exceptional automobile! A good size trunk will work for weekend getaways with my wife and 2 girls! The design is ""slick and sassy""! I've owned a '95 Lexus ES300 and a 2002 Volvo S80"
309	2075	The Acura TSX beats both, in every way, by a mile!
310	2076	Could not be more happier buying this car
310	2077	Its very sturdy and holds very well on freeway about 70-80mph
310	2078	Drives very well within city too
310	2079	get about 28mpg within city and 30-32 mpg on highway (mostly because of no cruise control)
310	2080	Excellent second car to have
310	2081	Very spacious too, can easily fit 4 people.
311	2082	I traded my 08 E350 Sport for a 2009 E350 sport mainly to upgrade to the new, faster electronics and music
311	2083	I found no major driving differences, however the HD radio, the NAV system, the Voice Command and the increased response speed for all technology functions is amazing
311	2084	There is almost nothing you can't do with the voice command system
311	2085	It even has a training module to improve the voice command's understanding of your input language
311	2086	Smooth ride and handling are accomplished with the sport suspension
311	2087	Since I had no problems with my 08, the 09 is just icing on the cake.
312	2088	"2009 F150 4x4 FX4 SC 5.4, with 3.73 rear locker, 145"" WB"
312	2089	I traded in my 05 F150 with only 20K miles for this truck, I didn't need a new truck because there was nothing wrong with my old truck,,,,,,, but I was so impressed with the quiet ride I bought it.
313	2090	Switching over from a Chevy Equinox, this car has been amazing
313	2091	I have no real complaints about the car
313	2092	It has 9,000 miles and has only been back to the dealer to have a sunroof put in and for oil changes
313	2093	I do see other peoples concerns with the awkward shifting, but it isn't anything that really bothers me personally
313	2094	The fuel economy says 24, but if you don't drive hard, I easily have cleared 27-28 in the city
313	2095	Great crossover for the reasonable price.
314	2096	Upgraded from a 2003 Focus station wagon with leather and moon roof ? I was looking for something practical, competent and reliable
314	2097	Found it in the spacious Forester
314	2098	Just would have wished road feel less SUV
314	2099	Nevertheless, the Forester beats its competitors? handling and demeanor
314	2100	So far drove 900 miles in city and on a trip to Texas Hill Country
314	2101	3 adults plus driver very pleased with comfort during 5 hours road trip
314	2102	Noise level remains low under 80 mph
314	2103	AWD shines on wet roads
314	2104	AC is more than sufficient for Texan heat
314	2105	Lots of goodies for colder climates
314	2106	Positively surprised by fuel consumption (comparable to old Focus)
315	2107	I have been pleasantly surprised at the fuel economy and pep
315	2108	I drive primarily country roads and I am averaging 28.7 mpg
315	2109	I was apprehensive about buying a four cyl., but the six speed trans really gives it great performance; it feels very peppy and is really fun to drive
315	2110	Unbelievably quiet ride for a car in this price range.
316	2111	I have 4,000 Kms on my new Hyundai and the wheel wells have cracked and are broken in the front driver's side and in the rear - both sides! Hyundai Canada will not consider this a warranty issue and will not honor repairing the car
316	2112	The car was driven on gravel roads at temps or - 35 degrees
316	2113	If the car should not be driven on gravel roads, that means the car cannot drive on 77% of the roads in Alberta!!!!! If this is what I have in two months driving how is the car going to look in two years? JD Powers are completely wrong with this vehicle
316	2114	Will never buy another Hyundai
317	2115	I had initial doubts about it
317	2116	But, seeing is different than driving - it is quite roomy from inside, performs very well in city and high way
317	2117	I love this rounded cube!
318	2118	This is a good car and there are good cash back recession incentives
318	2119	But here is why I think consumer reports lists owners to be less than satisfied
318	2120	When switching vent from defrost to vent or floor, the A/C automatically activates
318	2121	This cannot be deprogramed to function like a normal car
318	2122	Routinely end up driving with A/C on in the winter
318	2123	I'll adapt, but it's frustrating
318	2124	Back seat seat belt connector very rigid, difficult for kids to buckle w/ booster seat
318	2125	Not great maneuverability in parking lots
318	2126	Fuel mileage in city is much less than estimated - highway is good.
319	2127	I totaled out my 07 Mazda CX-7 and fell in love with the 2009 6 after test driving one
319	2128	I purchased an i touring and have no regrets with the 4 cyl
319	2129	The styling of this car is amazing
319	2130	The car has been mistaken for a Lexus three times
319	2131	This is the best car I have ever driven
319	2132	There is tons of room for the family and you never feel like you sacrificed style or performance
319	2133	If you are looking for a great performing, look at me style vehicle for a great price, this is the car for you
319	2134	Great job Mazda!!!
320	2135	My first real car was '77 Rabbit
320	2136	Drove Japanese and American afterwards
320	2137	Realized I missed my VW
320	2138	I absolutely love this new Jetta! Great torque through entire power band
320	2139	Love the tight German suspension engineering
320	2140	Manual transmission shifts like 'buttah'
320	2141	It's so much fun to throw the car into any curve, have it stay planted on the asphalt like it's on rails, give it some throttle and come rocketing out the other side
320	2142	WOW!! And this is the base S model
320	2143	Interior fit and finish is xlnt
320	2144	I'm 6'4'' and have plenty of leg/head room, compared to most Japanese cars
320	2145	There's enough bolster in the cloth seats for those curves, but still very comfortable for my daily commute to the city.
321	2146	No reservation with the 09 Scion I am delighted with the buy, would of love a 5 speed shift but its my work car and the reason for purchasing the car was for economic reason
321	2147	The Scion has proven after three weeks of ownership a bit of a good move on my part
321	2148	Economy is great, roomy, and fun to drive
321	2149	The 2.4 engine make the Scion get and go, economy of the car is really see at the low speeds, the automatic trans could use an additional gear, keeping the RPMs around 1.8k when on the highway and would make the Scion that much more economic for highway use, but with a tight engine I got 315 miles on the first out of town trip
321	2150	Please do not misunderstand the Scion is good on gasoline
322	2151	I've had my Corolla for two months now, it did 25.8 mpg city with a heavy gas hitter
322	2152	The trunk has room for all my golf clubs and the split seat works well for my fishing rods
322	2153	The placement of everything is logical accept the clock
322	2154	The center console is a bit small along with the little compartment with the outlet
322	2155	The plastic does scratch easily leaving marks
322	2156	Everything feels solid nothing loose and feeling like it would break
322	2157	The seating position can fit all, I'm 5'11 with long legs and it's really comfortable
322	2158	If your looking for an economy car that gives you the most bang for the buck, this is it
322	2159	A very big improvement from last year's model.
323	2160	Went to the dealership looking for a Highlander (same size as a Highlander)
323	2161	When we drove the Venza fell in love with it! We were impressed by the smooth drive of the car and the pick up on acceleration
323	2162	My husband loved it at first sight
323	2163	Love the comfort and room
324	2164	This car is the best...I love it!! Sporty looks, nice colors to choose from, love the keyless entry/start, storage, cup holders, auto windows up/down & more, the 4 cyl has plenty of pep and I feel like I have a little bit of a luxury vehicle but at a great price! I compared to Honda Accord but it was kind of boring...I just kept thinkin about the Altima and I'm so happy I went with my gut feeling and chose this over the Honda
324	2165	I have a child so needed a sedan for practical reasons, but I still wanted something a lil sporty too and this is it..the two pipes out the back add to the fun look and I got the rear spoiler which is nice
324	2166	Only wish I could get the fog lights.
325	2167	Fantastic car
325	2168	Extremely powerful and handles very well
325	2169	I didn't like where some of the controls were, like the cruise control and the window/locks being on the center console
325	2170	I expected a bit better out of the sounds system, my G6 in my opinion had a much better sound and much deeper, more powerful bass.
326	2171	I just sold my 7 year old 2002 Legacy Wagon L,with 215,000 miles
326	2172	It was very hard to part with,since it never let me down and will give the new owner many more thousands of miles
326	2173	I upgraded to the Special Edition 5 speed Outback on 11/01/08
326	2174	The test drive sold me
326	2175	I drive extensively in both city and highway
326	2176	This is a non-pretentious car that is as good looking at the campground as it is pulling up to a top Manhattan restaurant
326	2177	I expect the same reliability and longevity
326	2178	I also expect greater mpg than listed, since I did experience the same on my prior Subaru Wagon
326	2179	Also,annual maintenance is relatively inexpensive and resale value is high.
327	2180	I just got the new Camry and so far I am very happy with the purchase
327	2181	It is a sweet looking ride and handles very well
327	2182	Great stereo system
328	2183	The Fit is definitely a good car, but I am suffering a serious case of buyer's remorse
328	2184	I had an SUV before getting the Fit
328	2185	Do your homework for sure
328	2186	I did not get a good deal on it, which is part of my regrets
328	2187	I think you can get a lot more car for the same price if you went with a Mazda 3 for example
328	2188	I really wish I would have gotten that instead
328	2189	Gas mileage is good, but the on-board gauge is off
328	2190	When it says I'm getting 37 mpg, it really is around 32
328	2191	Still good, but instrument is unreliable
328	2192	You have to pay extra for many features that are standard for other models
328	2193	Insurance higher than on previous SUV
328	2194	Check w/ your agent first.
329	2195	I am very satisfied with my purchase..
329	2196	with a few exceptions
329	2197	The gas mileage is not very good
329	2198	I did my research and expected this
329	2199	However, in city driving, I am only averaging 14.3 mpg (according to the computer)
329	2200	Hopefully, the mpg will get better as more miles are racked up
329	2201	I have had nothing but raves from friends and co-workers about the exterior and interior of the car
329	2202	I chose Palladium Metallic with the taupe interior
329	2203	I think this combination looks very good on the car
329	2204	"Not one person has mentioned the ""beak"""
329	2205	I am not someone who likes to spend money so I did a lot of research before purchasing this Acura
329	2206	I believe my decision was correct.
330	2207	I have never driven anything so smooth and quiet, you can't even feel the vehicle shift
330	2208	It provides excellent sound barriers from the outside
330	2209	The seats and ride are so comfortable and the leg room is perfect for the taller population
330	2210	The investment is definitely worth it.
331	2211	This is my first Honda, I do have to admit it's a fun car
331	2212	Not to mention the reputation of this car was the reason why I went from a Monte Carlo SS (07) to a honda accord fully loaded
331	2213	So far so good..
331	2214	I hope with the proper maintenance it will last as long as my brother's accord with no problems (12 years.) 
332	2215	Bought the Limited today with an MSRP of $25K and invoice of $23K for $20K with the $3K rebate
332	2216	With $5K for my trade I financed about $17K
332	2217	Beautiful in camel pearl
332	2218	Comfortable leather seats
332	2219	Lots of headroom even with the sunroof
332	2220	Beige seats with black carpet & dash is really something different
332	2221	Great sound system
332	2222	Comfortable ride
332	2223	Very pleased
332	2224	Honda & Toyota had very incentives & wanted to have faith in the Ford Fusion, but couldn't
332	2225	Happy, happy, joy, joy.
333	2226	After almost 3 months of owning a new EOS I am still happy with the functionality of the sunroof, it has good torque throughout the RPM range even compared with other turbo engines, it has very good speakers but lousy sound unit (premium) but the worst for me is how it drives
333	2227	You have to be really delicate to avoid the car spinning like crazy when you start
333	2228	I have the upgraded 17'' wheels with Continental tires and that has helped little
333	2229	So at the end it dissapoints because the engine is great and the DSG gearbox is amazingly smooth but the car is not sitting on the road as it should and can become dangerous because of the big torque it has for its size.
334	2230	I only have 600 miles on the vehicle but I really enjoy it so far
334	2231	The gas mileage is increasing every tank full and I expect to easily exceed the 36 MPG rating for the car
334	2232	I wasn't sure I would like the placement of the speedometer but I can't imagine driving a car with a conventional speedometer now!
335	2233	Love the cx9! We test drove several cars until we decided to purchase a cx9
335	2234	We need the room of a minivan, but wanted something to please our teenage children
335	2235	They also love it! It drives like a car, similar to mazda6
335	2236	It is a large roomy suv, but feels smaller than it is
335	2237	We love using it for our children sport events, easy to bring cooler and gear for needed for games
335	2238	The sport version of the CX9 is a great value, you get many standard features for your money
336	2239	I bought this car right before winter started (I had a Toyota Matrix before) and boy was I glad! This car is great in the snow
336	2240	It gets me where I need to be, from snowy roads in New Hampshire through crowded streets and in tight parking spots in downtown Boston
336	2241	This car is powerful, small, easy to parallel park, and fun to drive
336	2242	Although it is small, it is well designed
336	2243	My son sits in the back in his toddler seat no problem
336	2244	I have also sat in the backseat, and while it isn't as spacious as a SUV of course, your feet aren't squished
336	2245	The seats and spacing is well designed.
337	2246	Traded in '06 Accord Coupe EX 5-Speed
337	2247	Great value for 6-Speed sport
337	2248	Little details with regards to interior and exterior styling make it feel like a luxury vehicle
337	2249	Also considered Accord EX-L, Subaru Legacy, Mazda6, Malibu, Fusion, & Acura TSX
337	2250	This was the best value based on 4-Door Sedan, 6-Speed Manual Transmission, styling, leather seats, etc.
338	2251	A little over a year ago I purchased a new Nissan Altima
338	2252	It was close to a strip model and I was never really satisfied with the car
338	2253	Checked out the Mazda6 with the 4 cylinder and thought it was a nicely appointed car but the power was not what I expected
338	2254	The dealer pulled around a Touring S model with the V6
338	2255	Wow what a difference, I was sold as soon as I hit the acceleration
338	2256	I got a great deal since they were having huge rebates and $1000 buyer loyalty credit
338	2257	(Also own a 2007 CX7) I had an 07 IS250 and this car is almost identical in looks and features in my opinion.
339	2258	No real problems yet
339	2259	Only have 900 miles on it
340	2260	Got a Sterling Blue V6 w/ Tech/Prem pkgs a month ago
340	2261	I've been enjoying the car very much
340	2262	"It's fun to come out of stores and have guys standing around the car and saying ""that's a Hyundai?"""
340	2263	"I got the ""wings badge"" for the trunk lid, just to keep them guessing"
340	2264	The car is a dream to drive, and very well designed inside
340	2265	I wish I had more miles on the lease, as I would love to just drive, drive, drive
340	2266	I expect that when this market recovers, this will be THE car to own.
341	2267	This is my first BMW
341	2268	I previously owned an Infiniti G35
341	2269	No comparison
341	2270	I always thought the car magazines were in the tank for BMW, until I bought this car
341	2271	It's my favorite car I've ever owned
341	2272	The engine reminds me of a sewing machine
341	2273	It it so smooth and never runs out of power
341	2274	The turbo is great
341	2275	I test drove a 328, which was nice, but it had no get up and go
341	2276	With 22000 miles on it, my 335 still feels solid as a rock
341	2277	I'm single with no kids, and the only reason I will ever get rid of this car is if my lifestyle changes and I need more room
341	2278	The backseat is way better than the Infiniti (an adult can actually sit upright), but it's still a pain to get in and out
342	2279	I traded in a 4Runner on the Camry Hybrid
342	2280	I went from 15 MPG to 38.6 MPG I drove from the DC area to Johnstown, PA over the weekend
342	2281	The trip is about 220 miles one way going up and down mountains and cruising up there at the speed limit +5 on cruise control I got 38.6 MPG
342	2282	I got a red Camry with every bell and whistle
342	2283	The nav system is OK
342	2284	"Most of what it tells you is on road signs: ""exit 38 is 1/2 mile on the left"" sort of thing"
343	2285	I found the consumer reviews very helpful so I decided I should give my experience
343	2286	I looked at Toyota Highlander(no 60/40 split 3rd row)and Acura MDX (2nd row of seats do not move adjust for back passagers)
343	2287	I kept coming back to the Buick
343	2288	This crossover is so quiet, it is riding in your living room
343	2289	We have already driven it on a long road trip and had no complaints
343	2290	The dealership was wonderful to work with and gave us a great price.
344	2291	Great SUV
344	2292	It is tremendously smooth and it has a ton of power
344	2293	It certainly ranks up there with all the other luxury SUVs out there without being priced as high
344	2294	The interior is roomy and comfy while the exterior is just flat out hot
344	2295	Love the fact that it has a back up camera without actually purchasing the navigation
344	2296	Push button start is nice but I don't like the fact that I can't listen to my music after it is off
344	2297	The traditional turn key allowed me listen to my music even with the car off as I can turn the key about three forth of the way
344	2298	Also wished the aux input was not located behind the center console
344	2299	Can't comment on the fuel economy as my Murano still needs to break in.
345	2300	 Month and 7k miles, I love this car, it is my favorite
345	2301	The car is easy to maneuver, great to park
345	2302	I like driving it in manual mode, where I can control the shifting and make it smoother
345	2303	It is good on auto but I prefer the manual specially since there is no clutch
345	2304	The transmission does adapt to your driving style, specially during the break in period.
346	2305	This my second Honda Accord and so far I love the car but hate the brakes
346	2306	After one day and 75 miles the steering wheel developed a very bad shudder when braking! I called the service manager and he said to drive the car at least 1000 miles before I bring it in? I am now at 950 miles with an appointment for next week
346	2307	The steering wheel shudder is still present on moderate and above braking
346	2308	I hope they can fix this!
347	2309	Have owned car for 3 months, very stylish outside
347	2310	Have LT1 version, interior seats are very nice though a bit uncomfortable especially for your lower back
347	2311	No carpet in the back seats, basically a big floor mat latched down
347	2312	I get 20.2 MPG
347	2313	My biggest problem with the car is the location of the oil filter
347	2314	I have changed oil on dozens of vehicles (new and old) but never had to change the filter from the top of the engine
347	2315	There is not enough room to place a filter wrench on the filter, it took 3 hrs for 3 men to unloose the initial high torqued filter by hand
347	2316	When the filter was loosened it went all over other components located underneath the filter
347	2317	Otherwise a great car and roomy.
348	2318	After totaling our Honda Pilot, we decided to go with a sedan
348	2319	Vehicles we compared against were Fusion, Malibu, G8, used G35, and Accord
348	2320	Out of the bunch, we kept coming back to the Mazda6
348	2321	Here's why: Fun to drive factor: there's no question that this car will be putting smiles on our faces for years to come
348	2322	Our 13 year old son even says it looks cool
348	2323	On some back roads in Talledega Forest, this car begged to be driven fast...80+MPH is where this car feels best
348	2324	Interior design and room: Only the Accord has more room, but the Mazda6 GT definitely has the best options...bluetooth, blind spot monitoring, top quality interior workmanship for this class, and an awesome audio system
349	2325	This has been a wonderful driving experience .The Diesel is very smooth and quiet and the highway milage is regularly over 28 mpg with average usually around 25 including city
349	2326	The interior systems are fun and easy
349	2327	The lift gate is great and at the right height to the ground and the space is more than ample.
350	2328	Very nice! Drives great! Definitely turns heads
350	2329	My opinion the black is the best looking of them all
351	2330	GM includes nearly all options on the hybrid model
351	2331	I added sunroof and leather seats
351	2332	Nice looking inside and out
351	2333	Comfortable to drive
351	2334	Power from the 2.4L 4 cylinder engine is fine for everyday driving and results in the following gas mileage
351	2335	24~26mpg around town, 32~38mpg at 55mph, 29~30mpg at 70mph
351	2336	"Even though this is a gas sipping green car, I like the agressive styling including 17"" chrome alloy rims"
351	2337	I have someone ask about it just about everytime I stop for gas, especially from owners of big SUVs.
352	2338	This Edge is my first cross over
352	2339	I replaced a Hemi Durango so I was hoping for better fuel milage
352	2340	So far this thing rocks
352	2341	plenty of power with great manners, and lots of room for a 6'3 guy
352	2342	Brakes are a little weak for such a light car
353	2343	This is our 3rd TL after owning the 02 & 06
353	2344	Ride and comfort are excellent
353	2345	After looking at Cadillac, Lexus, Infinity & BMW this is the best quality for the $$
353	2346	The Tech package is outstanding, we love it
353	2347	The ride improvement is excellent
353	2348	Drove the 4-wheel version, yes it has more HP and is faster but you give up the smooth ride for the firmer sport ride
353	2349	The 06 TL was the best road car we have ever had, can't wait to get the 09 on the road
353	2350	The seats are better than Lexus
353	2351	The rear leg room is much better than the 06
353	2352	I do miss the blue dash lights that was in the 06 TL
353	2353	It's a buyers market, got a great deal
353	2354	Like the new lines, but the front end needs to grow on you.
354	2355	Decided to buy a Subaru after owning 3 Hondas and 3 Toyotas
354	2356	"Moved to the top of a very steep ""second gear up"" hill 2 years ago and wanted AWD"
354	2357	Have had the Forester for 2 months and the quality seems to be quite good
354	2358	Snow season passed prior to purchase, but have driven my sister's 2007 Forester in the snow and it was a transcendent experience
354	2359	Handles well in corners and on highway
354	2360	Highway MPG is about 28
354	2361	Engine isn't a powerhouse during hill-climbing around town, but no complaint here with such good MPG figures.
355	2362	I bought this car 5 months ago to replace an SUV so was not sure about sitting lower to the road
355	2363	I was pleasantly surprised by this Vibe
355	2364	The drivers seat raises, giving me some of the height I used to enjoy
355	2365	This car is just fun to drive! Pick up is great, handles well
355	2366	My 17 year old loves to drive it too
355	2367	I have not had a chance to try out the AWD yet, but if my current satisfaction is any measure I know I will not be slowed by any snow!
356	2368	Extremely disappointed - first and last Nissan
356	2369	Vehicle initially worked fine for first month than began to shake violently when going into EV mode
356	2370	"Dealer ""fixed"" it but now it will not drive in EV Mode"
356	2371	Been back to two separate dealers both of which say its normal
356	2372	"First said it has ""learned"" my driving habits so it won't drive in EV the second claims EV does not work when the air conditioning is on (doesn't seem to work with it off) 6,000 miles on it and am ready to unload it"
357	2373	I absolutely love my car! This car looks hot(even better with tinted windows)
357	2374	I thought that the R/T offered quite a few options for very little money
357	2375	While the 4 cy
357	2376	engine won't beat anyone off the line, I do get about 24 mpg
357	2377	The ride is very smooth and the car is fun to drive
357	2378	There is a blind spot to get used to and the chrome around the gear shift can cause a glare, but otherwise I like the chrome look
357	2379	I enjoy having Sirius radio and I love having the radio controls on the steering wheel (a feature I thought I'd never use!) The interior is extemely roomy and there is a lot of trunk space.
358	2380	 I was initially impressed with this car, especially the price which was $16,000 cash, automatic, and nothing else
358	2381	I was in route to the Honda dealer but I passed by Hyundai and asked for a test drive
358	2382	I should have kept going
358	2383	The mileage is greatly overrated, at least in my view
358	2384	I have not achieved better than 18-19 MPG
358	2385	It dos not shift very well and remains in lower gears too long
358	2386	The ride quality is equally overstated
358	2387	I feel every bump and pothole
358	2388	It is a smooth ride only on well maintained roads
358	2389	Otherwise the ride is very harsh
358	2390	The build quality is not the greatest
358	2391	I have noticed rattles and noises even on minor bumps
358	2392	As I said, I should have kept going
359	2393	Perfect car to travel with because of its cargo arrangement options and seating space
359	2394	The comfort of the passenger seat was of utmost importance to us
359	2395	The seat is broad enough, has enough leg room, and recline capabilities so the passenger has positional options during a trip
359	2396	However it has one defeat-if books or grocery bags are placed on the front passenger seat the seat belt signal sounds
359	2397	Wish the passenger could do map tracking to specific hotels, food, etc
359	2398	while the car is being driven from area to area
359	2399	This would be wonderful for spur of the moment decisions while driving along
359	2400	Wish the width of the back cargo space immediately behind the back seat was the same as at door area.
360	2401	Outstanding engineering, safety, and quality
360	2402	Fantastic value
360	2403	Excellent purchase experience
360	2404	Free scheduled maintenance for 3 years
360	2405	Fun to drive
360	2406	Getting 34 mpg at 70 mph
360	2407	VW is the new BMW!
361	2408	Its a great little car for the price, I haven't had it very long so I cant say to much but its turning out to be a fun car to drive.
362	2409	We are looking for a mini van type of car without the mini van look that will work with our two little boys
362	2410	That's about the only one on the market now fits our need
362	2411	We also looked at Kia Rondo, but we don't like the look of the car and the fact it doesn't have the sliding door
362	2412	We got a base model 5 and installed after market navigation system and DVD
362	2413	After market DVD player looks much nicer and takes a lot less space
362	2414	Kids love it
362	2415	And this is the only car my wife actually loves to drive
362	2416	We are getting about 23-24 miles in town
363	2417	I have purchased 15 new Japanese cars since 1978 - Mazdas, Nissans and Mitsubishi
363	2418	This is my first Korean car
363	2419	I must say that I am very impressed with the Sonata compared with the many Japanese cars I have bought in the past
363	2420	Fit and finish are excellent, mileage is amazing (24.5 in the city, 34.5 on the interstate at 80MPH with the air conditioning)
363	2421	Many more standard features than most other brands and far less expensive
363	2422	Most comfortable sedan I have ever owned
363	2423	The warranty is far better than any Japanese manufacturer's
363	2424	After 3800 miles, I've had no problems whatsoever
363	2425	Although I've only owned the car for 3 months, I highly recommend the Sonata.
364	2426	In the last year I've experienced a complete engine failure due to spun rod bearing (as have 100's of others US and abroad), driven with an intermittent CEL for 2 months and been to the dealership 4 different times to have the problem resolved, I have multiple issues with the factory ECU tuning including a severe occasional hesitation, and about a dozen other manufacturer defects and dealer workmanship issues including a damaged intercooler, multiple components installed improperly, multiple components not installed at all (missing bolts, etc), and the vehicle now makes a wide array of abnormal noises
364	2427	Was fun to drive when it was running properly, but trust me its not worth the hassle!
365	2428	I just bought my Fit yesterday and the whole family just love it! It is spacious and comfortable
365	2429	I feel like I'm driving a sports car
365	2430	It has a great sounding stereo and the air conditioner will just about freeze you out
365	2431	I've had three new vehicles, but this one is my favorite by far.
366	2432	I traded my Mercedes GL450 because we wanted something slightly smaller, but not give up the utility, and luxury-comfort
366	2433	The X5 hits that mark perfectly
366	2434	It has sporty handling but is still luxurious and quiet
366	2435	Gets 20 MPG which is great in my book
366	2436	"I'm 6'4"" and 300 lbs and am super comfortable in it, and.."
366	2437	my kids have room in the second seats!
367	2438	Had a 1992 Honda Civic hatchback before this and wanted another Civic but I found I could get more for my money with the Touring
367	2439	I've driven if for about 600 miles so far and I love it more each day
367	2440	It has everything I was looking for and more; good safety features, lots of cargo space, fun to drive, my tall friends say the backseat is much more spacious than expected and very comfortable
367	2441	I got the vivid blue color and it's awesome
367	2442	I also love the black interior but it does show anything left behind of the fabric like lint from clothing
367	2443	I would suggest the sports package (sunroof, 17 inch alloy wheels, and heated seats)
367	2444	I'm getting on average around 24-25 MPG (mostly city driving).
368	2445	Great car, just what I expected and am very pleased with just about everything on the car
368	2446	This is an Autobahn with 6-speed and shifts like a dream
368	2447	For some reason the rear hatch washer leaks on the hatch window when open and leaks when the hatch is closed
368	2448	Been to selling dealer 5 times and tech support has been contacted
368	2449	Per tech, installed Tiguan check valve and the thing still leaks washer fluid
368	2450	Anyone else have this problem?
369	2451	Traded in my old 1995 Nissan 4X4 king cab for the 2009 Versa 1.6 L sedan with ABS and AC (cash for clunkers) The Versa is very comfortable, quiet, and very peppy on the road
369	2452	Happy to have the AC and the ABS, no radio though
369	2453	I got 400 miles on the 13.2 gallon fuel tank, not too shabby and that is with the AC on and in a lot of stop and go traffic
369	2454	Looked at the Yaris but it was more expensive and not as comfortable or quiet and considerably less roomy
369	2455	The Honda Fit was also less comfortable and less roomy plus more expensive
369	2456	The Versa may not be flashy looking but it covers all the bases and then some
370	2457	Even though the car had good reviews, I didn't want to drive it because, well, it's a minivan
370	2458	So glad I saw it in person
370	2459	"It's so much cuter than a big ol' behemoth ""mini"" van"
370	2460	It's perfect
370	2461	"I'm hauling kids to college in 2 short years and I wanted something small enough to park and maneuver, but with room for ""stuff."" I knew sliders were great for little kids, but it didn't occur to me until I took my mom to church how nice that access is for an elderly person, too"
370	2462	My in town mileage has been around 24.5 mpg
370	2463	"The ""auto"" climate control is taking some getting used to."
371	2464	I was a Honda man for years
371	2465	My company requires that we drive an American Auto for business
371	2466	After looking at all my options and driving many different cars, the Malibu won
371	2467	I am extremely happy with what the Malibu offers and look forward to the many miles we will travel together.
372	2468	The prius is incredibly economical and the advanced powertrain engineering is very clear
372	2469	"The interior space is exceptionally good, although at 5'11"" it would be nice if the driver seat could be moved and additional inch rearward"
372	2470	I have owned SUVs as well as sports cars and sedans, but this is one of the easiest cars I've driven yet
372	2471	In town this Prius gets 53 MPG and for day to day commuting it handles well
372	2472	It is not a car that I enjoy driving fast, since at the limit of handling it is a little unsettled
372	2473	The turn radius is fantastic though, and it understeers predictably through tight fast corners
372	2474	The acceleration is similar to a mid 70s American sedan - it won't win any races.
373	2475	I bought this for my wife to replace her minivan
373	2476	I needed an AWD people mover..
373	2477	we have 4 kids under 11
373	2478	Thought I was going to have to go with Toyota Sienna or Honda Pilot
373	2479	I'm glad I found the Flex
373	2480	Styling is so much cooler and Sync and Audio is high tech
373	2481	Two tone & Vista roof was a must
373	2482	You can't really appreciate vehicle until you climb in
373	2483	Interior is excellent quality & design
373	2484	Middle row leg room is excellent
373	2485	As Ford says DRIVE ONE
373	2486	I drove the FLEX 1st and was so impressed
373	2487	I never got around to the Toyota or Honda.
374	2488	I waited 5 months to write this review because I wanted time to adjust to the car
374	2489	Overall, its a good value for the money
374	2490	I also test drove the Corolla and Civic, but the low price and excellent warranty is the reason I chose the Spectra
374	2491	Handling is responsive and the car meets my needs very well
375	2492	Have just bought the 09 i touring
375	2493	Nothing but good things to say about the whole mazda buying experience
375	2494	No pressure to buy no no hard sells.Let me have my way on the test drive
375	2495	The 4cyl has great pickup, quiet acceleration, responsive steering, easy stopping
375	2496	Ride quality smooth and tight, build quality tops
375	2497	Test drove accord, camry, fusion
375	2498	While all were good I felt the 6 was the most fun to drive
375	2499	Also looks better than the competion.
376	2500	This car is my worst nightmare
376	2501	My friends said I downgraded from my 2000 buich century
376	2502	In city, im loosing 8 mpg-on hwy-12-16 mpg
376	2503	The steering is for a weightlifter--very difficult, hard
376	2504	The high seats on passenger side& inside trim at rear, make blind spots, you cant see the cars coming on the right side
376	2505	You ask--what about mirror? guess what, its so small, you can miss seeing traffic
376	2506	Seats are very cheaply made, w/hardly any padding for comfort
376	2507	And guess what---no glove box lock, or light to see, figure that
376	2508	I was appealed by this car, by its looks, not as a car & don't want anyone to do this stupid action
376	2509	If you take it home for 2 days---I promise you professionally--you will give it back.
377	2510	I test drove TL S-AWD, BMW 335 X drive, and G37 X
377	2511	BMW 335 gave me the best driving experience in terms of acceleration, handling, brakes, and comfort
377	2512	G37 was good too but not as good as BMW
377	2513	I bought the G37 because I got 6 grand off MSRP and it's roomier inside
377	2514	I'm sure it's a lot more reliable than BMW.
378	2515	Had this car 4 months now and love it
378	2516	My wife and I used to alternate driving our cars around town but now I drive everywhere
378	2517	The car is getting the rated mileage unlike the Nissan Versa I traded in
378	2518	I get about 21 mpg in 90% city driving and about 27 on the hwy
378	2519	You'll be hard pressed to find a family sedan with AWD, a moon roof and this level of refinement for the price.
379	2520	I have owned my 2009 Toyota Corolla LE since May 2008
379	2521	I purchased it right after they became available at my local dealership, and traded my 2004 Corolla, which I loved
379	2522	I fell in love with the redesigned body style of the 2009 model, but that's where the love ends! The biggest complaint I, and many other owners that I have talked to, have with the 2009 Corolla is the Electric Power Steering
379	2523	I cannot, for the life of me, keep the car in a straight line when traveling over 50mph
379	2524	I think that it is a design flaw that should get looked into
379	2525	Other than that rather annoying and potentially unsafe aspect, the build quality is comparable with the 2004 model
379	2526	Gas mileage is about 35mpg.
380	2527	I just got this car yesterday, but I had another 5 as a loaner for a week before that so I'm pretty acquainted with the car's peculiarities at this point
380	2528	We were looking at everything from small hatchbacks like the Honda Fit and Toyota Matrix to full-size minivans such as the Odyssey and Sienna, but the Mazda5 seemed like the perfect fit for us: it has plenty of space for a small family (up to 2 kids easily; 3 would be fine until you have to go for a long trip), it's relatively sporty and maneuverable, and it's much more fuel- efficient than minivans
380	2529	The kicker -- it's the only thing remotely minivan- like that offers a manual transmission.
381	2530	Looked to take advantage of the C4C deal and needed a car for my wife that would get good gas mileage, not overly priced and room for my wife to put all her cleaning supplies in as she has a cleaning business
381	2531	The elantra touring was perfect
381	2532	Plenty of room, great road manners, quite and great warranty
381	2533	She was driving a rodeo and at first missed the seat height of the SUV, but really loved the way the elantra touring drove
381	2534	Every day she tells me how she loves her new car
381	2535	Very very happy with the elantra touring.
382	2536	Have owned multiple Hondas
382	2537	Never met one I didn't like
382	2538	Easier to get in and out than my (wife's) 2006 civic coupe.
383	2539	This is a nice small - medium size car
383	2540	Has a very strong engine (for its category), a lot of space and it is priced better than the competition.
384	2541	Great car! I owned a 2003 CTS and this one is night and day! Test drove G37S, Audi A5, and Jaguar XF
384	2542	This car compares to all except G37S which was fast and fun but rough ride
384	2543	The Audi and Jaguar were overpriced compared to the CTS and features offered
384	2544	The only thing that bothered me on test drives was the cooled seats (back hurt)
384	2545	Bought car without cooled seats
384	2546	Other then this I love the car - cool look and great ride! Very good price for the features and quality provided
384	2547	Also 0% finance and fantastic rebates you can't pass up.
385	2548	Well I didn't actually purchase it, though if I had money for the downpayment, I would have taken it right then and there
385	2549	I test drove it, although I would prefer the SL trim level, but they didn't have it yet
385	2550	The ride, very comfortable, very smoothe, and enjoyable
385	2551	When you see it in person, it is really strange, it looks so small, like a rock or a toaster with wheels, but CAVERNOUS inside
385	2552	I really hope I can purchase it.
386	2553	Very nicely laid out interior
386	2554	very Spacious with easy entry and exit from all seats
386	2555	Even my mother in-law (a very large woman) said it was easy to get into and out of the passenger seat and the second row
386	2556	Did not attempt the third row thankfully
386	2557	Decent acceleration and stopping is also good
386	2558	This is not a race car after all but a family transporter so set your expectations correctly and you won't be disappointed
386	2559	The sound and video systems are excellent! Usually do not even consider a Ford
386	2560	I am converted.
387	2561	I bought the car while Toyota had $2000 cash back deals
387	2562	I got additional $400 military discount
387	2563	The price was phenomenal
387	2564	This is my second Corolla
387	2565	I owned 1997 Corolla and it did not give me any problem
387	2566	With the new one, I average about 27-30 mpg per tank (80% city & 20% hwy)
387	2567	I have standard stereo and the sound quality is very decent
387	2568	Overall, I'm very happy with the car.
388	2569	I absolutely love this car
388	2570	I got it loaded and it has all the amenities of a luxury automobile along with the sportiness
388	2571	I was shocked and sold when I sat in one and it was extremely comfortable and roomy
388	2572	Get a convertible or a sunroof because they operate great
388	2573	It gets great gas mileage and all maintenance and the entire car (Including paint and body) is guaranteed for five years
388	2574	I don't have to change the oil or nothing
388	2575	All i have to do is put gas in it and that isn't very often
388	2576	What a wonderful car!
389	2577	I have only driven German cars for the last 25 years - lifestyle change took me to a top of the line Tahoe 3 years ago and while it was a good car, it was too 'trucky' - so was heading back to Deutschland
389	2578	Until our Chevy sales guy enticed me to drive the Traverse
389	2579	A month later, I am in love
389	2580	Have put 2,000 miles on it with no problems
389	2581	It holds a large amount of stuff as well as 4 humans
389	2582	It handles well, is comfortable and we are getting 18 mpg in town and the promised 24 on the road
389	2583	GM has a chance if this is a sample of their future.
390	2584	Had a 2007 Versa and loved it, so got a 2009..
390	2585	great commuter car
390	2586	Just want a reliable comfortable car with good MPG and got it
390	2587	So much room inside, it is really unbelievable - 350 lb
390	2588	passenger in back seat was very comfortable
390	2589	Two-hour drive on hills, no problem..
390	2590	performance was great
390	2591	Plenty cargo room since interior so spacious
391	2592	I have been disappointed in this vehicle! The insulation in this vehicle is poor
391	2593	The heater works wonderfully but just about freeze my legs on the driver side
391	2594	The dealership installed an electronic start and I believe they have messed up the electrical system as nothings seems quite right
391	2595	What about the mileage
391	2596	I am seeing 15-18 and I now have 4000 miles on this vehicle and am NOT speeding
391	2597	I left my keys in the car and turned OFF yet in less than 3 hours my car battery was totally DEAD
391	2598	This certainly can't be a safety feature to have a battery lose charge this quickly
391	2599	I agree about the noise!
392	2600	I have the Fit Sport with navi in manual transmission - it has VSA and ABS
392	2601	It has excellent handling in the snow
392	2602	2 days ago we had snow here in New York, and in our area we had about 6 inches
392	2603	I decided to try out the ABS system and the VSA system of the car
392	2604	So I drove on streets that were not yet plowed, particularly on those with some elevation, so the car had to climb
392	2605	Having manual transmission, I was able to drive slow, (the proper way of driving in snow)
392	2606	I was in full control all the time
392	2607	Not once did the wheels spin or slide - because the VSA corrected it immediately
392	2608	I was passing SUVs and minivans in the Palisades Parkway who could not make in elevated inclines
393	2609	I bought this truck in 2009 and so far have put 1000 miles on it
393	2610	So far so good haven't had a problem with it yet
393	2611	I'm not sure about fuel economy though, I have the 4.0L V6 and I get 14 in the city
393	2612	I'm suposed to get 17 in the city and 20 on the highway
393	2613	Other than that i love this truck
393	2614	Its the best one That you can buy for the money
393	2615	I wouldn't reccommend this truck unless there is only two people in your family
394	2616	Previously owned two 6-cylinder Jaguar X-Types
394	2617	The Audi A4 ride is fantastic; the 4-cylinder Quattro engine is very powerful
394	2618	Tiptronic manual shift is fun (but dangerous-- must be careful to avoid speeding ticket)! This vehicle is beautiful, roomy, and hugs the road
394	2619	Because it's low to the ground you have to be careful when parking, so the front end isn't damaged by concrete barriers.
395	2620	A very nice way to put 14 minivan years behind me
395	2621	Like minivans, my Vibe is practical and versatile
395	2622	Unlike minivans, the Vibe is economical and fun to drive
395	2623	But the Vibe GT is a few details short of perfect
395	2624	I exchanged the 18-inch wheels standard on the GT for the 17-inch wheels optional on other models
395	2625	I lost some tight cornering ability but gained a whole lot more in noise reduction and comfort
395	2626	Blind spots force me to trust the mirrors more than I?d like
395	2627	I had back-up sensors installed to allay fears that I would back into something or, worse, someone, such as the grandchildren who live with us
395	2628	I would have also appreciated an in-dash compass
395	2629	Still a great ride and purchase.
396	2630	I bought this 6cy AWD explicitly for very long drives along the Great Lakes Snowbelt in winter - dangerous conditions
396	2631	I held my nose while considering SUVs and minivans
396	2632	This car was a reasonable compromise
396	2633	The seat is firm and surprisingly comfortable on a 500 mile drive
396	2634	The vehicle handles firmly and assertively unlike Toyota's other models
396	2635	I call it a vanagon; it felt large at first, but it really is more like a tall sedan than anything else
396	2636	I have a black one with that ridiculously toothy chrome grill, which seems to be a desirable feature on higher-end vehicles
396	2637	But it goes like a tank in the snow and hauls a medium amount of stuff
396	2638	Expect good resale from it and I feel safe.
397	2639	I wanted a compact car with good Gas mileage
397	2640	I think I got one with this 2009 Aveo
397	2641	It's fun to drive
397	2642	It rides better than I thought it would
397	2643	and I get 32 MPG in the city
397	2644	I think GM finally has built a good compact car
397	2645	It has more pick up than I thought it would
397	2646	Not to good on a up grade but it's a compact car
397	2647	I only had it for about a month now and I don't think it has any blind spots in it
397	2648	The side windows are big
397	2649	The engine runs quiet and it has a good ride on the highway
397	2650	only one thing wrong with it, made in Korea
397	2651	If anyone wants a compact car they should take a good look at a Aveo.
398	2652	I received this as a Christmas present from my Dad this past Christmas
398	2653	I'm 18 and this was a huge upgrade from my grandma's 1994 Ford Tempo I was driving around
398	2654	All I can say is wow
398	2655	It has a good amount of power and the brakes are fantastic
398	2656	I drive it pretty hard, but I still get about 26-28 mpg doing a mix of city and highway driving
398	2657	"It's hard to explain, but the car just feels ""solid"""
398	2658	The doors close with a dull thud, instead of a hollow bang
398	2659	Even things like the turn signal lever feel well built
398	2660	The steering is tight and easy to maneuver, even at high speeds
398	2661	The ride is overall excellent.
399	2662	In my opinion, people give out too many 10s these days, so I'm trying to make my review as realistic as possible
399	2663	I've always driven a truck, but seeing the way the economy is and fluctuating gas prices, downsizing is the smart thing to do now
399	2664	I don't have a lead foot, but I'm not always the most conservative driver and I'm getting 38 mpg doing about 30% city/70% highway
399	2665	Looks great on the outside, the build quality is good
399	2666	As far as reliability, I believe it was consumer reports that put it in its top 10 list of reliable cars at #7 so that's definitely a good thing
399	2667	"Overall, I'm happy with the car and recommend it to friends when they say ""Nice bubble, do you like it?"""
400	2668	I researched many cars offering similar amenities
400	2669	The KIA appeared to offer better features for the lowest price
400	2670	I was not disappointed, it has great features and is very well built
400	2671	While not a powerhouse the engine offers sufficient power for highway driving
400	2672	The seating layout and flexibility is well done providing real flatbed storage
400	2673	The transmission is smooth
400	2674	I wish that KIA offered a larger tyre option, but it is not a major flaw
400	2675	The finish and engineering are of high quality
400	2676	The entertainment system, bluetooth and component inputs make offer more luxury features than are found on many prestige cars
400	2677	I was surprised and disappointed to find an ashtray, GPS space would be better.
401	2678	I was extremely unhappy with my PT Cruiser (*ahem* PT LOSER) and did a LOT of research on the Fit and comparable vehicles
401	2679	I test drove the Fit, Yaris, Cube, and Versa
401	2680	I even drove the Yaris for 2 days while deciding
401	2681	But after those 2 days, the decision was easy
401	2682	The Fit by FAR blew the competition away
401	2683	I have DOUBLED my mpg over the PT
401	2684	Cargo space is amazing, and have easily fit my two large greyhounds, and last week a 6 foot industrial clothing rack
401	2685	Have put 1800 miles on it in about a month
401	2686	Fit also made list of greenest cars
401	2687	Drove over a nail this week and the TPMS alerted me to low tire pressure
401	2688	Now I look forward to driving every day, instead of wondering if my car will start! 
402	2689	I recently purchased the Limited V6 with NAV, Leather, Bluetooth
402	2690	Have about 700 miles
402	2691	Averaging 28.5 MPG true Highway, 24 MPG Limited city, 21MPG City
402	2692	Overall very impressed with vehicle
402	2693	Drove the Camry and the Sonata blew it away in comfort and styling
402	2694	Only knock is slight hesitation in acceleration after decelerating
402	2695	Nav performs great and much smaller than most vehicles and touch screen a plus, Bluetooth has good performance
402	2696	The fit and finish is far superior than the 2008 Sonata
402	2697	Seats are very comfortable and dual zone temperature control feature is awesome although temperature seems to run a little hotter than actual
402	2698	Purchased car during 2K rebate
402	2699	No regrets with purchase.
403	2700	The ratings I base on any car that's as fuel efficient as this one
403	2701	Much more fun to drive than a hybrid, yet gets nearly the same mileage
403	2702	Spacious, back seat fits adults, seats comfortable on a 1400 mile, three day trip
403	2703	Be wary of the hype that the car will get over 50 mpg
403	2704	Trying real hard I can get 45 - 46
403	2705	Around town I've been getting much better than I'd guessed, 38 - 40
403	2706	I have the manual and keep the car at 1500 rpms unless going uphill
403	2707	Never needs to be at more than 2000 rpms unless in top gear, passing or entering a freeway
403	2708	Averaging 70 mph you will be lucky to exceed 41 mpg
403	2709	It's in the constant 50s and 60s that 46+mpg is possible.
404	2710	I Love My G8
404	2711	I was waiting for the Camaro to come out but came across the G8 and fell in love
404	2712	It looks means and corners great
404	2713	Everybody asks me what it is or if its a BMW or Mercedes
404	2714	I love the look of the interior especially the radio
404	2715	We were driving a 2500 diesel so we chose the V6
404	2716	But now I want the V8
404	2717	So who knows I might be upgrading
404	2718	Mines Black on Black
405	2719	I love this car
405	2720	I did a ton of research and was between the Civic and Corolla
405	2721	I am so glad I chose the Corolla
405	2722	I am averaging 33 MPG living in the burbs! The XLE interior is wonderful and I am glad they came out with this trim for 09
405	2723	I was not looking for a fast car - my main priorities were: gas efficient, comfortable, reliable and stylish, and the Corolla covered all! I love the new body design for the 09 Corolla.
406	2724	I had been looking for a car for several months
406	2725	When the new body style was released I fell in love
406	2726	I use my vehicle to drive to and from work and school
406	2727	She (my TSX) has taken good care of me
406	2728	I look forward to getting in my vehicle every morning, traffic or not she is amazingly comfortable.
407	2729	I had a Mercedes R350 with all the options, and I drove the Flex and looked at the price and said what the heck am I doing driving a Mercedes, I returned the Mercedes 5 months early to get the Flex, I could not find the SEL with leather and Nav, so I settled for the SE and will install the Nav
407	2730	Best bang for the buck bar none! THANKS FORD!! 
408	2731	This is my first BMW
408	2732	Thought I wanted to own one to see how I liked being a Bimmer owner
408	2733	It's a nice ride but is TOO expensive for what you get
408	2734	Not much value for the money
408	2735	I also hear the whining noise coming from the engine or transmission
408	2736	Sounds like the whining sound from a turbine, but the car does not have a turbocharger
408	2737	The sound varies at different speeds and engine torque
408	2738	Sometimes not very noticeable at all
408	2739	The seats are also hard comparable to competition
408	2740	Nice build quality though
408	2741	Not much luxury options for the buck though.
409	2742	The lancer drives very well
409	2743	It's as quiet as any of it's competitors, as corolla, etc
409	2744	It soaks up most of the bumps with minimum effect in the passenger car
409	2745	It's engine, a dohc with Mitsubishi Innovative Valve Timing and it's continuously variable transmission both work to make the ride pleasant
409	2746	I've had two prior generation lancers and they all were highly reliable, with minimum repairs and breakdowns under severe use
409	2747	The car is very safe and sturdy - uses very strong steel
409	2748	The only flaw is that the epa fuel economy is already below it's competitors and below the prior generation lancer 2007
409	2749	And when you drive it - it seems like it's below the epa estimates also - especially city.
410	2750	I have seen this car on road and at traffic stops
410	2751	Looked at other cars- compared price, reports/reviews, recalls
410	2752	Shopped 4 dealers with my trade-in,got the best deal at my local dealer by $600 and within $300 of what I wantd
410	2753	The dealer-salespeople were fantastic
410	2754	was going to pay for it but 0% financing-ok/ The car is really great-fun to drive-more than enough headroom-free Garmin-car loaded w equipment.Dont wait! good pickup and passing-26.8 mpg n town so far
410	2755	Going on trip this weekend!! Car is quiet, no road noise,will pull out in front of traffic from red lite-corners good- give it some gas going around corner- like on a motorcycle,no body lean,stops quicker than on a dime!!!
411	2756	I've had the car for a few weeks
411	2757	However, very disappointed in the windsheild wipers
411	2758	If I would have known this, I wouldn't have purchased the car
411	2759	The left hand wiper shimmers at the bottom; brought it back and was told they can't fix it
411	2760	Another major issue is that the right hand wiper makes a line smack in the middle of the driver's viewing
411	2761	I just got back from driving in the rain and it was dangerous
411	2762	The line distorts viewing
411	2763	I'd say this is a design flaw in the placement of the wipers and the wipers themselves; buyers beware!
412	2764	This is a well-engineered, solid vehicle at a reasonable price
412	2765	The vehicle provides better road visibility as it sits up higher than a sedan, decent mileage, and is flexible enough if we need to transport small stuff (e.g., chairs, boxes, etc.)
412	2766	The ride is kind of rough, not sure if a change of tires would help, or that's the way it is supposed to ride
413	2767	Same problem as poster JLM.Totally dissatisfied and would not buy it again
413	2768	Car in dealer for at least 10 biz days for a problem that I believe VW know about all along
413	2769	The DSG transmission is the culprit and appears in all VWs-not onlyt he EOS
413	2770	Check the VWVortex website for similar stories
413	2771	I wish that I had before I bought this mistake.
414	2772	Our family had been looking at replacing our mini-van (Honda) for about 6 months
414	2773	When our 2003 Odyssey sold in less than 24 hours, we ended up having to make a quick car purchase
414	2774	Thankfully I had been doing lots of research
414	2775	My 1st choice was a Chevy Tahoe, but I wasn't that thrilled with the size and lack of cargo space
414	2776	We drove the Mazda CX-9, Acura MDX, Toyota Highlander, and the Honda Pilot
414	2777	Of all of the vehicles, Honda had the smoothest ride
414	2778	My husband and I are both very tall, and we fit comfortably in both the front and second row seats
414	2779	The gas mileage isn't great, but it wasn't any different in any of the vehicles we drove (I'm not sure why it is constantly brought up)
415	2780	I am a great advocate of the Nissan Murano
415	2781	Been driving one since 2003 and have no performance or reliability issues with the car
415	2782	However I was disappointed when I purchased my 2009 SL and I could not get an iPod integration kit installed or a remote start kit installed from Nissan
415	2783	I would assume these are common accessories today, especially the iPod
415	2784	Just disappointed in Nissan's decision to exclude their mid range Murano owners.
416	2785	My wife and I are looking for a second car because were having our first baby
416	2786	We saw the cube at the Nissan dealership and fell in love instantly
416	2787	There is not a car out there with a cooler combination of interior and exterior styling and it's really fun to drive.
417	2788	Bought this car for use as my wifes and myself commuting car and to keep the SUV in the garage to keep the miles off it and save some money in gas
417	2789	We keep the rear seats down and use the area as a cargo area
417	2790	The dogs love the cargo area as well
417	2791	We purchased an after market rubber mat that covers the complete cargo area (with the seats down)
417	2792	The car looks small on the outside, but inside there is a lot more room than you'd expect
417	2793	We did look at the Honda Fit, but liked the look and the wat the xD drove
417	2794	Also, the local Honda dealer marked up the price of the Fit by $2500 over MSRP and unwilling to negotiate off that price
417	2795	Glad we passed on the Fit
417	2796	The Xd fits our needs.
418	2797	very nice drive, the tan interior looks great, smooth ride, no complaints about the car
419	2798	The 2009 Acura TL-SHAWD w/Technology Package is very fun to drive while offering interior amenities and technology that are second to none
419	2799	The 09 335x is more fun to drive and faster but lacks the interior space and modern amenities
419	2800	The 09 Infiniti G37 is faster but lacks the driving refinement and interior space and amenities
419	2801	The 09 TL offers it all at a very competitive price
419	2802	Very happy with my purchase.
420	2803	The 2009 BMW 335i is even more fun than my previous 2006 BMW 330i
420	2804	I had a great experience with my previous 330i and didn't think there was much room for improvement
420	2805	The 2009 335i takes an already near perfect design and adds just a little more in a lot of area
420	2806	The engine is something you just have to experience by driving the car
420	2807	Great power at all speeds and seems to beg to be driven harder
420	2808	The handling is great in the curves
420	2809	The new iDrive is fantastic
420	2810	This is not the sluggish iDrive system of the past
420	2811	If you are into tech toys and can operate a modern cell phone you will love the new iDrive
420	2812	If you like performance cars go test drive one
420	2813	Just be prepared to want one.
421	2814	This is not a sports sedan
421	2815	It is a small, efficient urban two passenger transport that has a small footprint but a spacious interior
421	2816	Being a Daimler product it has the safety and quality expected
421	2817	Having a small Mitsubishi engine, it is no surprise the performance and reliability it has
421	2818	Being a European design, it has character and head turning style
421	2819	Over all this little car has fulfilled and surpassed every design objective and it is fun to drive around town
421	2820	It is priced well for the market.
422	2821	Great ride, love the navigation, easy to use
422	2822	Seems to shift strange
422	2823	Mileage has not been as good as promised
422	2824	Good looking and fun to drive
422	2825	Have had many compliments on this vehicle from strangers in parking lots
422	2826	Cannot believe that the back bumper is not real chrome
422	2827	For the price of this vehicle it should be real chrome not paper.
423	2828	Bought the 2009 R/T R package (Road and Track) - I think it is well worth the extra money - improved handling and the top line seats - only drawback they are (or at least at the time I bought) very hard to find
423	2829	So far the car is great to drive - very comfortable on road trips - I can drive all day long
423	2830	I also bought the upgraded sound system (Boston), best sounding factory installed system I have ever had
423	2831	I live in Wisconsin, drove once in the snow earlier this year and I am planning on driving year round - from what I have experienced car should handle as good as any non 4X4 - just have to drive with common sense! Dodge rebates plus lifetime warranty backed by the gov't sealed the deal
424	2832	This new CTS made it even less painful to get rid of my old (2006) CTS
424	2833	This car is pure pleasure for me
424	2834	I love everything about it except the fact that it feels so smooth while I am driving it that I don't realize that I am going so fast
424	2835	I loved my old one but this one stands out by far! Would suggest this car for anyone who is looking for a luxury thrill
424	2836	The only thing this car doesn't do is make me coffee but it has a button for that and will direct me to the nearest Starbucks.
425	2837	Just purchased this car for my wife, we researched and test drove the Camry, Fusion, and Mazda6 as well but selected the Altima
425	2838	It has what we felt was the best finishing details/trim and was sportier than the Camry and Fussion
425	2839	The Mazda6 was a close 2nd place but our local dealer didn't have much of a selection
425	2840	We have owned Mazda 626 and a Camry in the past and really like both of them, but the Altima just fit our needs better this time
425	2841	Probably a little more in price when equipped comparably, but worth the extra $$
425	2842	We love it so far.
426	2843	My wife drives 20k miles/yr on business
426	2844	She's put 90K on a Grand Marquis in 4.5 yrs
426	2845	She likes my 08 Santa Fe, but wanted something more stylish with a high sitting position
426	2846	She loves the Venza! High style, room of an Avalon for adult business associates and friends, space for occasional hauling projects
426	2847	An Avalon wagon!
427	2848	Midyear model in midnight sky was the car I wanted after reviewing everything I could about the nissan vs.mazda3,honda civic and toyota corolla
427	2849	Had it two weeks now and very happy about choice
427	2850	Great price too(rebates from dealer and nissan to dealer in addition to 4500 cars voucher) made it a no brainer
427	2851	Interior comfort and roominess was best of the group
427	2852	"I am 6'2"" and interior size was important"
427	2853	Great acceleration and smooth,seamless transmission, Handling is pretty good and quiet for a small car
427	2854	The only negative comments I can make is the oddly shaped rearview mirrors and security alarm going off when unlocking trunk without unlocking doors first
427	2855	Otherwise s solid choice.
428	2856	I am pleased with most things about this SUV
428	2857	It gets over 25 MPG on the Hwy with average speed of 70 MPH, but in town I am very disappointed
428	2858	In normal city driving it gets 13 to 14 MPG.
429	2859	Had for 6 months and have put 4,000 miles on it
429	2860	Had a 2006 sportage and saw the optima and had to have it
429	2861	I am blown away at the attention it gets
429	2862	People are always telling me they love its looks and the red color is sharp
429	2863	I just smile when I pull up beside a accord or Camry and think to myself I saved thousands and have an equal car
429	2864	The optima feels smooth and plenty of power from the I-4 it only has a few less horse power than the v-6, save a few bucks and buy the I-4
429	2865	The trunk really holds a lot and the car is comfortable on long trips
429	2866	The gas mileage is as advertised which many cars do not match up
429	2867	So we are very pleased
429	2868	We do recommend kia to everyone we know.
430	2869	We just picked up the new 2009 SE-G Challenger
430	2870	She's a sweet, boss looking ride
430	2871	The 1st one off the rail car from the factory, and we got her! Inferno pearl red is a head turner at every light in town
430	2872	The base MSRP, 09 Challenger is nice, but the dealers are still trying to sell them like the numbered SRT*8, 08's
430	2873	The 3.5 high output V6 is not very quick off the line, but very quick to respond after you'er out of 1st gear
430	2874	The car feels well balanced and can scream around bends and turns like the best of them
430	2875	Outstanding road feel and a rocket on the Hwy
430	2876	The G package ( 26G )has larger rims, fog lights, all speed traction control, 4 wheels ABS disc brakes, electronic stability program
431	2877	After driving the Mazda6, none of the other cars I tested (Altima, Accord, Legacy, Camry) could match the combination of features/performance/style
431	2878	The acceleration is better than I expected with a 4cyl and the suspension has an excellent balance between handling and comfort
431	2879	The Michelin tires do squeal too early though
431	2880	The dashboard is very intuitive and easy to use
431	2881	The GT has more features than I know what to do with
431	2882	I especially love the blue tooth connection for my cell phone
431	2883	The only minor disappointment is the gas mileage
431	2884	After 2 months, I'm only getting 21 mpg in combo city/highway driving but that's a small price to pay for an excellent car.
432	2885	I've had my Journey for 3 months and already have had the sunroof, power steering, transmission, and main wiring harnesses worked on
432	2886	The oil light came on before 3000 miles and I got the recall about the wiring harness about the same time
432	2887	I made an appointment and had the service department look to see why the car made a load noise when turning left
432	2888	The Power steering was replaced and the transmission started slipping between 1st and 2nd gear also gets stuck in 5th gear and causes my mpg to be about 16.5
432	2889	Now the the dealership is leaving it up to Chrysler to figure out.
433	2890	I first got into Toyota in my 2000 Avalon XLS
433	2891	Then my 2003 Avalon XLS
433	2892	In Oct.07, I bought a 08 Camry SE
433	2893	I just traded it for my 09 Avalon Limited
433	2894	I would ask why buy a bottom end Lexus, this high end Avalon is perfect
433	2895	The room in it is exceptional and it has all the comfort features you could want from a luxury car
433	2896	The price points of Toyota are exceptional and have better negotiations than Lexus by far
433	2897	Toyota warranties are not as good as Lexus but then they don't break either
433	2898	Toyota, thank you for making such a GR8 car! I love it.
434	2899	I love my corolla! It's fun and easy to drive
434	2900	The car handles well, gets 30 mpg routinely, has cold ac, and the JBL stereo is great
434	2901	I think the interior dash design could be upgraded, but that's my only complaint
434	2902	With the reliability of Toyota, I'm sure I will be driving this car for many years to come.
435	2903	I have only had my 370z for 2 days now and it is the best one yet
435	2904	I have owned a 1978 280z, 1984 300z, 1991 twin turbo z, 2003 350z, and now the 370 and all where great but none compare to 370! If Nissan keeps getting this car right at this kind of price I will still be driving a z when I'm 80 yrs old.
436	2905	Comfortable car, good to drive powerful 3.5L with V6 engine
436	2906	compare to Nissan Maxima and Altima v6 engine and Honda Accord
436	2907	I'd rather buy Toyota Camry a little cheaper price and the model look good too 
437	2908	Our experience with this car has been nothing but positive
437	2909	We are military so we drive from Florida to Texas once a year(about 1,000 miles)
437	2910	On our trips(we've gone twice so far), we average about 40 MPG
437	2911	Once we even got 42 MPG!!! The cabin is very quiet and I can actually speak in my normal voice! I love the bluetooth feature
437	2912	Since we live on a military base, driving while on the phone is illegal and can cause us major trouble
437	2913	I love how quiet it is at stop lights
437	2914	I can hear myself think!! This car is reliable, and beautiful inside and out
437	2915	I also love the 6 cd changer and the separate temperature control
437	2916	We couldn't have made a better decision !
438	2917	Well I recently purchased my Vue hybbrid to help me lower my fuel costs
438	2918	I have to drive 270 miles a day round trip for my job
438	2919	I needed a vehicle that was roomy enough for me and woulld improve my mpg's
438	2920	Most of my trip is on the highway
438	2921	This vehicle has cut my fuel costs in half
438	2922	I was getting about 14MPG in my Jeep GC and am now getting 31MPG in the vue hybrid
438	2923	I live in the Catskill mountains of New York and have to drive down to the office in New Jersey
438	2924	This vehicle has done well even in the mountains
438	2925	I hope the vehicle will be reliable considering the high mileage I will be putting on it
438	2926	About 1200 miles a week.
439	2927	This is my third Avalon
439	2928	I am still getting used to it but overall, I really like it
439	2929	It has a great ride and is very quiet
439	2930	The only thing I do not like is the hardness of the drivers seat
439	2931	I can feel something under the padding, perhaps it has something to do with the seat's cooling feature
439	2932	I have been driving around for the last 4 months with a thin quilt under me
439	2933	This makes it more comfortable
439	2934	Hopefully the seats will break in and I can take out the quilt
439	2935	Other than that, I really love it.
440	2936	I love my Lancer
440	2937	I went to the dealership not thinking that this car would be what I wanted, and I actually had an appt
440	2938	with an Infiniti dealer the same day
440	2939	After test driving this car I fell in love with it
440	2940	The pickup is great in the 2.4 and the ride is quiet
440	2941	I have the dark gray and people think it's the small BMW! I trade my cars in every 2-3 year (lease) and always went for the high end 6 cylinder cars
440	2942	This car is just as good if not better
440	2943	I love driving it, the ride is really wonderful!
441	2944	We replaced my wife's 2002 Mazda Tribute with this after a great deal of research
441	2945	Love the quality and build
441	2946	Very comfortable; rides like a car not a truck
441	2947	The Premium sound system in the Limited is among the best I've ever heard (and I drive Lexus) Satellite Radio is nice extra that's standard
441	2948	What sold us, too, was the outstanding warranty
441	2949	V6 engine is quite sufficient for this vehicle and auto trans is smooth
441	2950	Overall, very pleased with this purchase and the $2000 incentive from Hyundai made the purchase of this cost about as much as the Tribute did 7 years ago! 
442	2951	There have been many complaints about this being a rebadged Chrysler
442	2952	For what it is, the Routan is outstanding
442	2953	There is no way to get a Wolfsburg designed and built minivan to the U.S
442	2954	in this price range
442	2955	VW is trying to capture the market for their customers who already have a VW and need a family hauler
442	2956	We have a Jetta, and needed more room for our growing family
442	2957	"While every aspect of it may not be ""German Engineered,"" it surely is ""German Inspired."" The ride is great, the layout inside is well though out (we have a bench instead of the captain's chairs for the 2nd row, much more convenient in my opinion)"
442	2958	Would definitely recommend
443	2959	I have had this truck for around a month now and I am very impressed
443	2960	It flat moves and is stable doing so
443	2961	I purchased it to replace a 2002 C class MB that I loved but missed having room to haul anything
443	2962	So far it's two thumbs up! Anxious to take a road trip in the next 2 months
443	2963	Vegas to Denver should be a good test
443	2964	Maybe a bit of off road testing hopefully
443	2965	The gas millage isn't anything to write about at this point but it's only got 1000 miles on it
443	2966	It feels like a Benz..
443	2967	That's the best part!
444	2968	I haven't had this truck for very long but I am impressed with it so far
444	2969	It rides smoothly, has good fuel economy, and is very fun to drive
444	2970	It has a lot of power for its size
444	2971	Its handling is tight and is easy to move in tight spaces
444	2972	Over all it's a dependable little workhorse.
445	2973	Another great Subie
445	2974	I have an 08 Outback and a 09 WRX
445	2975	Fast?....oh yea! Handles like a rally car and goes in the snow
445	2976	The best of both worlds, along with Subaru's legendary reliability
445	2977	Getting on the freeway is always exciting, 0 to 100 in a flash...I'm in my sixties now and am loving the exhilaration of having a race bred rocket, with the drive- ability for all weather conditions
445	2978	A great value from the folks at Subaru
445	2979	Gas mileage? If that's a concern, buy a Prius
445	2980	Purchased with the SPT Cat Back exhaust, Short Throw Shifter and Turbo Gauge.Interior Foot-well Lights are a very cool touch
446	2981	Yes, the best vehicle I've purchased in my 45 years buying new and used cars
446	2982	Zero defects, outstanding mileage
446	2983	I think it combines the best combination of mileage, safety, capacity, and price of any vehicle in the U.S
446	2984	market today
446	2985	Its $3,000 income tax rebate made it a $25,600 purchase price for me plus tax and tag
446	2986	Noticeable improvements over the 2008 model I test drove early in the year
446	2987	You could coast for a long time between 35 and 40 mph on electric alone! Mine is still on break-in and the average mileage with AC on half of the time (Miami,FL) is 33.6 mpg
446	2988	This is on a mix 50% suburban, 30% city, 20% highway; and American made to boot.
447	2989	Went from a 2001 BMW X5 to a BMW 330i and now back to a 2009 X5
447	2990	Needed the X5 to pull a boat, which it does with ease
447	2991	The 2009 is much improved over the 2001 in terms of build quality
447	2992	The 2001 X5 did have mechanical issues
447	2993	I do miss the handling of the 330i but for a SUV, the 2009 X5 is as close as it gets!
448	2994	This is my first new car and I really like it
448	2995	I was testing 2008 altima coupe 2.5s and Honda accord coupe exl
448	2996	Even though I like the long term reliability of Honda but I like the style and performance of altima coupe
448	2997	It is much quite than the Honda accord
448	2998	I would recommend this car to anyone who likes the sport car
448	2999	Accord coupe is also a beautiful car but I think it is still like a family car
449	3000	We have 3 kids and couldn't see affording $30,000+ for a new minivan or a cross-over
449	3001	This car was much more affordable and will cost much less to maintain
449	3002	It rides like a car, but has a interior layout like a minivan
449	3003	We won't be able to tow a boat or carry an 8' wide piece of plywood, but we never did when we had that capability with our previous minivans
449	3004	The kids love it, but we haven't taken the first vacation in it yet, so we may be sacrificing on space and power when the car gets fully loaded with luggage
449	3005	I'm a tall guy and I push the limits on most cars
449	3006	Leg room and head room could be better, but I fit and I like the feel when I drive.
450	3007	The CR-V is my first SUV
450	3008	It was purchased to deal with the deep winter snows we've been getting here more often
450	3009	So, while I'm most interested in utility, finding that the CR-V really handles well, has great road feel and peppy performance is an unexpected bonus
450	3010	Gas mileage is higher than I expected, too
450	3011	This is a thoroughly excellent vehicle.
451	3012	Althrough I've had this car for only a short time, less than three weeks, I did drive a 2008 Impala for a year (company car)
451	3013	Because of the pleasant experience with the '08 I decided to buy an '09 when I had to return the company car
451	3014	However I find the 2009 to be extremely uncomfortable as compared with the 2008, specifically the lumbar
451	3015	It doesn't deflate all the way as it should, and it really really hurts my back (and others who have driven my car)
451	3016	This seems to be the way it is on all 2009's
451	3017	"(No problem with the 2008's.) I've been told ""this is the way it is"" and nothing can be done"
451	3018	This flaw should be corrected but I suspect it will not be because it's not a safety issue.
452	3019	This is an amazing great car with unmatched value
452	3020	My wife and I absolutely love it
452	3021	Our friends are very impressed
452	3022	We've owned it for 4 months and I waited until now to do the review
452	3023	At 3500 miles, with majority (~80%) highway driving, the long-term mileage has been 24 mpg
452	3024	As the flagship for Hyundai until the Genesis, one clearly senses that a whole lot of thought had gone into the design, and care into the build of this car
452	3025	So far, this has been the most issue-free car I've owned, including Camrys and Accords
452	3026	There are people who would rave about this car if it was a luxury brand, but are more reserved as a Hyundai product
452	3027	The Azera should be continued, to convert these skeptics
453	3028	I bought a CRV after reading reviews here and Consumer Reports
453	3029	I have been very happy with the car since buying it
453	3030	It feels very well put together and is comfortable to drive
453	3031	It's not a Maserati but that wasn't what I was looking for
453	3032	I just wanted basic transportation, reliability, and a price that I could afford
453	3033	I'm definitely happy to own this car and I expect many years of use.
454	3034	After more than 6 months of driving my 09 TCH I still think it's one of the best cars I have ever owned
454	3035	I was getting between 34-42 MPG when I first got it, but that was being easy on the gas peddle, now, with much more aggressive driving, I'm getting 28-34 MPG
454	3036	Still impressive for a large car
454	3037	I just found out my car ins
454	3038	for the hybrid is HALF the cost of the Highlander I traded in! 
455	3039	If you want to save on gas but still want to buy something that's has some style to it, this is your car
455	3040	I loved the redesigned look of the latest Camry when it out, and this new 2009 corolla is like a smaller version of the Camry
455	3041	The exterior of the S model is beautiful in person, most pictures don't do it justice I think
455	3042	The interior is nice and there is plenty of room for a family of five
455	3043	Myself, my wife and our 3 girls (one who is still in a safety-seat)
455	3044	The JBL stereo upgrade is well worth it, it sounds great with plenty of deep bass, and the added Bluetooth support that comes with it is a God sent
455	3045	We are so glad we chose the Corolla, it fits us just fine!
456	3046	Just purchased the new 2009 Venza, 3.5, V6, AWD, Black with roof rack, cloth seats on 24 June 2009
456	3047	A nice looking ride and easy to dive
456	3048	Fuel economy supposed to be 18 to 25 MPG
456	3049	Just a few days the best MPG so far is 12.5
456	3050	Also seating is very firm and hard on the bottom
456	3051	Suggest future years Toyota put in a more comfortable seat
456	3052	In addition, suggest this great looking car have memory front seating for the driver and passenger
456	3053	I've read all the reviews on this vehicle and many other people have stated the same recommendations: (memory seating to include side view mirrors and more comfortable seating
457	3054	The styling of this car sets it apart from all others in its class
457	3055	This is our second BMW and I'm a hard sell for import cars
457	3056	BMW gets greedy with there options they are priced to high and there is no such thing as a base model on the lot
458	3057	I love my Forester
458	3058	I find some of these reviewers asking for things that are available if you are able/willing to pay for it
458	3059	I searched many other cars and found that Subaru's AWD is by far the most reasonably priced
458	3060	If you want a great stereo and lumbar support, don't go with the base
458	3061	However, if you want decent payments on a reliable SUV, go for the base
458	3062	It is a great vehicle that handles well, steering is responsive and I never feel as though my safety is compromised
458	3063	I love my car.
459	3064	Just picked up my wife's 2009 Alpine Gray tiguan with nav and panoramic roof
459	3065	Wow! This vehicle is fast 
459	3066	Stops on a dime
459	3067	And is surprisingly comfortable
459	3068	"My wife keeps referring to it as ""awesome"""
459	3069	She loves it 
459	3070	It is a gti in disguise! In my opinion
459	3071	Build quality is superb! VW and Audi have a winner on their hands in my opinion
459	3072	Not for the faint of heart! A must drive before you buy anything else!
460	3073	Let me start with I checked out just about everything out there in this price range and took my time making a decision as I did not need a new car but rather wanted one
460	3074	After looking for over a year I decided on the Honda Civic EX 5 speed and so far am very happy with it
460	3075	The car rides nice and handles very well for what it is (I had Miata's, and MG's before this) the deciding factor was the Honda's resale value compared to everything else
460	3076	If you are looking for a well built, fun to drive and reasonable cost to operate car look at the Honda Civic! The EX model has all the toys you need, sunroof, 4 wheel disc brakes, cruise, and a decent stereo system
460	3077	I paid 17,451 including destination
460	3078	Love IT.
461	3079	This is a great truck
461	3080	Just be smart about what you are buying
461	3081	I am really happy with my Ridge
461	3082	I wanted a truck that was reliable, comfortable, and had longevity designed in - not planned obsolescence
461	3083	It is not a big Ford or Chevy - it is a medium sized truck more suitable for a person who values convenience, storage, and intelligence over outright brawn
461	3084	I couldn't be happier as this vehicle fulfills all my needs for a truck - adequate towing, people mover, great ride, good at the lumber yard/garden center - in a 4 wheel drive long lasting Honda package
461	3085	For most of us that want a truck, don't tow more than 5000 lbs, and don't live on a farm, this truck was designed with us in mind
462	3086	This my first Honda purchase
462	3087	"The Fit is the absolute most fun you can have with 115 HP! No matter what speed you are going, there is always more ""get up and go"" when you need it"
462	3088	A high quality small car! Without the high price
462	3089	If you are in the market for a fuel saver but also desire peppy performance with great utility this car is the only way to go
462	3090	Bravo Honda! 
463	3091	I have been wanting this vehicle for the longest time
463	3092	The heavy snowfall in Erie sent my wife and me over the edge and we got the Tacoma
463	3093	Simply love it
463	3094	"Tons of room in the cab for me (I'm 6'3"") and a car seat in the back"
463	3095	This truck handles amazing in the snow and ice
463	3096	I have yet to get stuck..
463	3097	and I have tried! The safety features Toyota put into this truck are really impressive and allow it to handle great in all conditions
463	3098	Lots of power, gas mileage is not the best, however, its much better than other trucks out there
463	3099	All in all, I am very happy with the Tacoma
464	3100	Traded 2001 Passat on my first Acura, not as smooth/quiet of a ride, but for the $$ a good trade off
464	3101	Looking for better reliability along with gas mileage
464	3102	Last 5 tankfuls have exceeded 33 mpg, country driving 45 to 55 mph for 50 miles R/T per day
464	3103	No problems after 4 months
464	3104	A must look for the $$ with many standard features compared to models in the same class
464	3105	Looked at Audi A3/A4 & Honda Accord.
465	3106	This is my fourth Z and is clearly the best in overall performance and can match or outperform almost any sports car on the road
465	3107	I test drove a Porsche Boxster the day before I bought the 370Z and it matched its performance as well as being quicker
465	3108	I had some reservations about the restyling from the 350 before I saw it, but it's gorgeous
465	3109	The Sports Package, with SyncroRev matching, TC, bigger and dagger styled wheels is worth it
465	3110	"At 6'0"", I felt very comfortable in the cockpit.I usually negotiate the price down, but even at MSRP, it was a steal"
466	3111	I wanted a truck from another manufacture, but due to cost and gas prices we focused on small SUVs
466	3112	I'd driven an F150 before and loved it, so we looked at the Escape
466	3113	The one negative was KBB's prediction about resale value (but I keep cars a long time so not a big deal)
466	3114	I was impressed by the safety ratings (my number one priority), and liked the safety features available
466	3115	The SYNC system is great, it?s easy to see all the way around the vehicle (no blind spots and easy to back up)
466	3116	At 60 mph I get 31 mpg, at 80 mph 25mpg; not bad for an SUV
466	3117	It's well designed and wonderful to drive (I enjoy my commute now!)
466	3118	A great vehicle and a good value (we got it below invoice)
466	3119	I love my Escape!
467	3120	Traded an 07 C6 for this 09 6 spd SRT8 and could not be happier
467	3121	The comfort level, smooth ride, and power when you need it is what driving a car is all about and this car has it
467	3122	It certainly does get the attention from others
467	3123	Dodge did this one right.
468	3124	This is my third van (the other two were a Ford and an Olds) and the Toyota is definitely the best riding
468	3125	Build quality is excellent and the engine very smooth and powerful
468	3126	At this point I have no complaints, but have high expectations based on Toyota's reputation
468	3127	Will keep you updated
469	3128	Hey out there, All you new 2009 370Z Car owners need to ensure that your 370Z Car can handle high Ambient temperatures
469	3129	I live in Georgia, and the ambient temperature is almost always above 90 degrees, during the months of June, July, August and September
469	3130	I've had numerous contacts with Nissan's Consumer Affairs Department, regarding the 370Z Car's need of an ENGINE OIL COOLER
469	3131	The 370Z can not handle driving at speeds of 60 MPH, or more, with out the ENGINE OIL TEMPERATURE reaching the 280 degree mark, which is what Nissan indicates is the MAX OIL TEMPERATURE the car should operate at
469	3132	All 370Z car owners should contact Nissan's Consumer Affairs Department and demand a RECALL! 
470	3133	I traded a 2007 Toyota Camry SE-V6 for this Murano LE in April and could not be happier! Great styling, excellent performance, fine handling (for an SUV) and decent fuel economy..
470	3134	what more could I ask for? OK, I could ask for more, but then I would have to purchase a new FX-50 and spend an extra $15K or more!
471	3135	I brought this after having a Toyota Camry wagon for years, and a Subaru Outback for past 7 years
471	3136	In two months I have put only 1500 on it
471	3137	I love this car, got 34 with NO AC on a longer trip, getting 20-22 around town
471	3138	Both above EPA estimates for this 2.4 auto
471	3139	Love the handling and pep, the styling is distinctive and attractive, many compliments
471	3140	On the practical side, hey I never buy a vehicle I can't sleep in, and this is no exception with lots of room, love the folding FPassenger seat
471	3141	Roofrack is study for bike
471	3142	Its a sporty hatchback/small wagon, and a welcome change from poor mileage with Subaru AWD, which I do not need in Central Virginia
472	3143	Excellent Truck for the money
472	3144	Sticker 48k yet was out the door tax, title and license for $35500.00 (still can't believe it) Laramie trim is excellent, sound system and hard drive are great
472	3145	Fuel economy is not bad for a 4X4 that ways in at more than 5500 pounds
472	3146	Very smooth ride
472	3147	Built in AC/DC converter is a great feature as well
473	3148	Have had this car for about 4 months and 5,000 miles
473	3149	I am very happy with the car and its performance
473	3150	Build quality is excellent and handling is superb
473	3151	I love to drive it just about anywhere
473	3152	I bought it with the 6 speed which is quite nice
473	3153	Great clutch but shifter is a bit notchy
473	3154	Should get better with age
473	3155	Got a great deal with .9% interest with BMW paying the first 2 payments
473	3156	I'm getting a solid 23 mpg and more on the highway
474	3157	I wanted to buy an suv for the longest time, but with current gas prices..
474	3158	not too much of a chance UNTIL the TIGUAN..
474	3159	great on gas, super comfortable
474	3160	Pretty quick, lots and lots of space..
474	3161	I couldn't be any happier with my purchase, worth the wait! =)
475	3162	The steering on my brand new 2009 2WD Pilot was pulling to the right the first day off the lot
475	3163	At first, I thought it was the road, but the pull was consistent on all road surfaces
475	3164	After calling the dealer, I discovered that Honda did not redesign the springs for the all-new 2009 Pilot, and as a result, the alignment problems are becoming prevalent
475	3165	Here's the problem: the 2009 models have more weight distribution in the front compared to 2008 models, and heavier springs should have been used
475	3166	The dealer indicated they needed Honda approval to fix the problem
475	3167	The fix consists of replacing the right front spring with a rear spring from a 2009 4WD model
476	3168	I have owned the vehicle for 9 months & 16,000 mi
476	3169	and it is still a great car! No problems, great ride & handling, good performance from the 4 cyl
476	3170	engine and on highway trips over 37 mpg! Love all the standard features and a warranty that shames Toyota & Honda and many more
476	3171	If all the vehicles in its class cost the same I'd still pick the Sonata
476	3172	What a bonus that its thousands less!! 
477	3173	Needed a 2nd car for all my kid pick- ups and drops
477	3174	Our Suburban has a severe drinking problem and is in rehab
477	3175	Looked and researched every car in this category
477	3176	It was between the xD and the Fit
477	3177	The xD was $2k less than the similarly equipped Fit and the fit/finish and engine performance was much, much better as well
477	3178	Also, the Honda dealers came across as very snotty about the Fit, not my thing
477	3179	Didn't notice any difference between the manual and auto when testing
477	3180	Handles amazingly well
477	3181	Feels sporty and luxurious inside
477	3182	Great on the hwy as well as our rural roads
477	3183	MPG - solid 31 city (hilly and curvy) and 38 highway
477	3184	Will be the kids' car in 2 yrs and they love it.
478	3185	I leased a new Lexus IS 250 AWD after being told that the new model been updated for 2009
478	3186	Yes, there are some minor styling and other changes, but it's still a 2006 technology platform
478	3187	For example, the navigation system has no text to speech, no traffic info, outdated maps, poor routing - you could do better with a portable unit for $150.00
479	3188	Traded in my SUV for the more efficient Vibe (sounds like a trend, doesn't it? Luckily, I only ended upside down by about $900 on the deal)
479	3189	I was never a big fan of the older vibe
479	3190	It just looked like a grocery getter, bland, wagon-like and just something moms and old ladies would drive
479	3191	But the 2009 Vibe caught my eye, particularly the GT trim
479	3192	It's sleek, sexy and with the economical yet punchy 2.4 L option, I was sold
479	3193	This is the 5 speed automatic version (there's no option for this, hello Edmunds!)
479	3194	Small but roomy, powerful but economic (29 MPG on average!), great interior (the seats are SO comfortable), and this car is hot! Getting a lot of stares! I would recommend this car!
480	3195	Our family decided on the 2009 Limited RAV4 after the first test drive
480	3196	We were impressed with a quiet, smooth, and comfortable ride
480	3197	We also enjoyed the extra space the vehicle provided
480	3198	We doubted the gas mileage ratings, but after 2 months we believe! We live in a rural area of PA and are getting 28 mpg
480	3199	On our first 12 hour trip, we got close to 30 mpg
480	3200	We find the leather seats very comfortable and enjoy the bluetooth phone capabilities....no more worries about getting the phone up to the ear! Keyless entry is nice but can be confusing
480	3201	I researched just about every available source and they all pointed to this vehicle
480	3202	Limited with leather is more comfortable than the Base.
481	3203	I didn't really purchase the car but my family rented it
481	3204	Rides very nice and is very comfortable
481	3205	Best Toyota I have ever ridden in
481	3206	The motor is very quiet and the car is very nice
481	3207	Keep it up Toyota! 
482	3208	I purchased my new Sienna LE about two weeks ago
482	3209	I needed a safe, comfortable, reliable and good looking van to carry my family
482	3210	I got all of that ? plus a surprise ? great gas mileage
482	3211	The overhead multi-info display was showing an average of 27 mpg while driving on the freeway but I expected it was lower
482	3212	It turned out to be 25.7 mpg from fill-up to fill- up
482	3213	The interior trim looks beautiful
482	3214	A road I must pass over every day has lots of potholes and patches
482	3215	My other vehicle rattles like crazy over this area but the Sienna does not make a sound and stays in complete control
482	3216	All-in-all, a great vehicle and a great value.
483	3217	I bought my Civic LX two weeks ago and am generally very pleased with it
483	3218	BUT, I am disappointed that Honda has not entered the 21st century along with Saturn and other cars by providing remote trunk access with their Civic LX
483	3219	The apparent reason: to provide a disincentive to buy the LX, and push you to buy an EX for $2000 more
483	3220	So, if you have kids, if you shop and appreciate easy trunk access as you lug items to the car, buy another car
483	3221	Is remote trunk access worth $2000? Not in my book
483	3222	Next car will be a Toyota.
484	3223	I can't believe that you can purchase a vehicle with all of these features for such a low price
484	3224	Electronics are outstanding.
485	3225	I've had the car from 3 months now, close to 5,000 miles on it
485	3226	"Not that I'm over the initial ""ooh & aah"" of having a hybrid, what I have is an excellently running, gas saving vehicle, but a little on the boring side"
485	3227	This is not a sports car by any means, and I realized that when I purchased
485	3228	However, the interior just seems to bland and dull to me and the ride is way too soft
485	3229	"Come time for new tires, I will look into adding on the 18-inch rims and the TRD suspension to ""sport up"" the ride a bit"
485	3230	I didn't want the nav system because of not being able to program while car is in drive, so opted for cloth seats, but got everything else with it.
486	3231	This will be my 4th Nissan car
486	3232	I have had a Sentra and 2 Altimas and got them all new and now a 2009 Versa! Never had any problems with any of them, general care, tires @ 70,000 miles and old change on a regular basis
486	3233	My Versa car was purchased for the price and gas prices for driving to work
486	3234	Its just me and my husband
486	3235	Versa base model with no extras no power locks,no power windows, etc
486	3236	I researched all the other types of small cars in this area with about the same conclusion
486	3237	Versa! 500 miles great car
486	3238	Design area: No place to put your right arm while driving
486	3239	Light in car not good for front light for people in the front seat
486	3240	All in all good car for the price and gas needs.
487	3241	I've had this car for just over a month and we (my wife and I love it)
487	3242	I had a hard time choosing between the 3 series and the G37 but my wife made the decision easy because she preferred the G37 interior
487	3243	The navigation and premium package was a must and because we hadn't bought a new car recently, the blue tooth and backup camera were nice features
487	3244	What got us to the dealership though was predicted RELIABILITY and we chose Infiniti based on my wife's positive experience with Nissan.
488	3245	The 6 speed 2.4L v4 is definitely the way to go
488	3246	It has great fuel economy and is built as good as a BMW in my opinion
488	3247	It is great to see that you do not need the v6 (which I had in my last car) to get the quiet ride and good acceleration
488	3248	I was looking for a good family 4-door sedan that would also be fun to drive back and forth on my long commute to work (on the congested roads of NJ)
488	3249	Based on my budget of 20-25K, I had considered many new cars and also a low mileage BMW used car
488	3250	After test driving, the Malibu was the clear winner
488	3251	My wife and I were actually shocked at how smooth and quiet the ride was (though tried to keep the smiles off our faces before negotiating the price).
489	3252	I owned my car for about 24 hours and I know that's not quite long enough to know all the in and outs
489	3253	But this thing is amazing
489	3254	I driven an Evo, and for the $10,000 price cut, this will not disappoint
489	3255	One thing though good luck finding one.
490	3256	This is a great car!It is super fast, silky smooth,and a lot of fun to drive
490	3257	It has a feeling of solid precision at 90 MPH.The handling is excellent.Some reviews have said you have to get used to the CVT.Not me,I got used to it on the test drive.This car has an endless supply of smooth power.Also the car looks gorgeous.I have been getting about 22 miles per gallon with fast driving.
491	3258	Having traded my gas-hog GX for a new RX, I am pretty happy overall
491	3259	The car is comfortable, sufficiently powerful, and endowed with some features that the GX didn't have (such as HID headlamps that swivel, a power liftgate, and fold-flat second row seats)
491	3260	But I am a bit disappointed at the rattling sunroof shade and another rattle emanating from the right front dashboard area
491	3261	I try to remind myself that I'm getting better mileage to counteract the annoyance
491	3262	But after driving only 300 miles so far, I hope this doesn't foretell a future of other things going wrong.
492	3263	My husband and I drove almost every car before we purchased our 2008 Impala LTZ
492	3264	I love it so much! The interior is beautiful, and the seats are really comfortable, I love my sun roof, and both of my boys have more than enough room in the back seat
492	3265	The trunk is huge! We have an Eddie Bower stroller which is huge in itself and it fits in there with room to spare
492	3266	We had to evacuate when hurricane Ike came through last year, we fit one pack&play, three suit cases, stroller, briefcase, big pack of diapers&wipes, small ice chest, dog food, toys, a portable baby swing, sheets and a comforter and it all fit, with more room in there
492	3267	It drives so smooth and quiet! I recommend this to anyone!
493	3268	I bought this vehicle the end of July 08
493	3269	Always thought I wanted a Charger
493	3270	After test driving both I found I prefer the G8
493	3271	It has more power than I'll ever need and very comfortable seating
493	3272	My teens vibrate the whole car with their music, but otherwise the sound system in great
493	3273	And I found it affordable.
494	3274	At first I thought perhaps I was being hypersensitive, but the more I drive may Aura (3.6 engine), the more I hate it
494	3275	I initially considered taking it in to see if something was wrong with it, but I had a 4cyl loaner for a day and it was even worse
494	3276	"I looked on the blog to see what others thought and the very first review I read summed it up - the transmission ""hunts"" and it is ""jerky"""
494	3277	It is so jerky that it feels like you are driving a stick shift, but you have not control over it
494	3278	I am so upset about spending big bucks on something that makes me nauseous to drive - I wish I could return it! 
495	3279	Nearly perfect sporty commuter with room for the toys on the weekend
495	3280	Fantastic value for the money
495	3281	Gives 30 mpg in very mixed driving
495	3282	Nothing seems cheap
495	3283	It's very well done
495	3284	It's the most car you can put around a 2000cc engine
495	3285	Not a rocket ship, but more than enough go for a great daily driver
496	3286	I love this car, everyone stops me and wants to talk about this car, I went with the se model due to pricing.
496	3287	Add dual cat back exhaust where I felt more power response
496	3288	Getting the Windows tinted was not a good experience..
496	3289	Thinking about adding cold air intake down the road, I had one problem with mine at 500 miles had a problem with the engine? told me the flywheel was damaged? scary but the dealership fixed it, and had no problems since at least for now the car is great to drive, wish the v6 had a little more power..
497	3290	The car looks great! Smooth ride on the highway
497	3291	Seats are comfy! Love the chrome finishes on door handles & front grill
498	3292	If you're a 'driver' you'll love the steering, suspension and handling
498	3293	Plus, the car is tight, engine is smooth and interior is perfect
498	3294	But..
498	3295	HD radio is terrible
498	3296	Constantly flips in & out of HD, save your money
498	3297	BMW won't fix it
498	3298	Auto trans is also sketchy
498	3299	In sport mode it won't ever go to 6th gear and regular mode just doesn't downshift readily
498	3300	If you're doing 40 MPH and step on it, it bogs down unless you press deep on the pedal
498	3301	It makes the car feel underpowered
498	3302	But you can punch it down a gear (or 2) with paddle shifters (I have sport pkg)
498	3303	Had a 330i with 5-spd prior to this and power wise, this is a little disappointing
498	3304	If you're on the fence..
498	3305	get the Turbo! Wish I did.
499	3306	Lease deal was $473/Mo
499	3307	$2199 upfront
499	3308	I am quite satisfied its styling and convenience
499	3309	Platinum Gray Metallic has edge at every corner, awesome color
499	3310	I really enjoy tight and rich should of Lexicon
499	3311	A Hyundai, you've never seen before
500	3312	I am absolutely in love with my Versa
500	3313	Previously drove another Nissan and so was interested in buying another one
500	3314	As a first time buyer did a lot of research on cars and found this to be the best
500	3315	Initially I wasn't interested in a hatchback but this has more of a sporty look and that old timey station wagon feel
500	3316	Comfortable car, features great, and good for road trips
500	3317	As a recent graduate, the price was extremely affordable
500	3318	I would pick this car again and again if I had to do it over
501	3319	With three little boys under the age of 6 I finally decided to get a practical, safe and reliable minivan
501	3320	I owned an accord in the mid 90s so I knew they were reliable
501	3321	Well, come to find out things have changed
501	3322	Since day 2 the check engine engine light has been on and my Honda has seen more of the mechanic in three weeks than my 9 year old Land Rover has in the past year!! It's a shame because the primary reason one purchases a Honda is for its reliability.
502	3323	I just purchased this yesterday! I went to the dealership for a used SUV
502	3324	Discovered the Venza and fell in love
502	3325	This is a beautiful CUV
502	3326	Roomy, luxurious and very eye catching
502	3327	It has zing...so much I'm bound to get a ticket! It's very attention getting and handles much better than a standard SUV
502	3328	It's so nice
502	3329	I'm so happy with it
502	3330	It's a soundproof car drive, but has the size of an SUV
502	3331	Home improvement store, auctions and grocery runs will continue with this CUV
502	3332	It's a very nice vehicle
502	3333	Great price for this auto!
503	3334	Chrysler nailed it when they built this baby! The retro styling and big engine take me back to when I had my old muscle cars
503	3335	"This car is not about economy, thrift, or ""green"" driving"
503	3336	"This car says ""I love to drive!"" The acceleration is heart-thumping, the braking is excellent, the handling is very good and right down to the ""thump"" of the doors, everything is just as a muscle car should be"
503	3337	"The only thing that I wasn't prepared for was the ""rock star"" treatment from people everywhere"
503	3338	People stop their cars beside mine, the give me the thumbs up, I have even had some guys ask me to pop the hood
503	3339	I have met quite a few good people through this car
504	3340	Although the 2009 looks pretty much like every Prius since the 2004 redesign I think it's still a good looking car
504	3341	For a small car the interior is spacious, lots of leg room even in the back seat
504	3342	The seats recline to an almost flat position if needed
504	3343	The rear seats lay flat opening up the storage space of the hatchback for plenty of storage
504	3344	Up front there are two glove compartments, a small compartment under the radio, a sunglasses compartment overhead, and two large compartments between the seats
504	3345	On the road I find the Prius has plenty of get-up-and-go when needed and the touchscreen display gives me the feedback I need to maximize my fuel economy
505	3346	Smooth ride, comfortable seating, plenty of space to take the family on a twelve hour ride to our vacation destination, then twelve hours home
505	3347	This vehicle is worth a serious look for those considering the large SUV
505	3348	The price is a pleasant surprise, and comparing it to the GM and Ford equivalents, we saved many thousands and got a great vehicle
505	3349	The hemi has smooth fluid acceleration and alot of power.
506	3350	All I can say about this car is that it has everything you need and more and for 2009 they have really cut down on wind and engine noise from 2007 and for 2010 they are getting a new interior.
507	3351	This by far has been the best experience in any of the cars I have driven
507	3352	The car has a lot of speed for a 4 cyl and also it has a sport gear
507	3353	The interior is really comfortable, and I so far have not had any blind spots! Could not ask for more in a car! 
508	3354	I just turned in my 2007 Acura TL
508	3355	I loved that car, it had great styling, performance, and gas mileage (in the last two regards, it still beats my new Benz)
508	3356	But as far as refinement is concerned it's not even close, the MB blows away the Acura
508	3357	I test-drove a TSX and couldn't believe how much cheaper it felt than the Benz (despite the difference in price, my best Benz lease deal is only $14 more per month than my best TSX offer)
509	3358	I planned to purchase an Altima Hybrid based on superior reviews in Edmunds.com
509	3359	However, when I test drove both vehicles, I found the Toyota Hybrid superior in almost all regards
509	3360	True the Altima handled better than the Camry, but the Altima was noisy and the gas engine continously cycled in and out of operation
509	3361	By comparison, the Camry is quieter, the gas engine only cycles at appropriate times and the ride is quieter than the Altima
509	3362	It is clear to me that the Camry Hybrid is a more sophisticated implementation of hybrid technology.
510	3363	Car is great looking and is great on fuel as well
510	3364	The lights go on automatically when it gets dark and with the sun roof the Gt 2009 Pontiac Vibe is an eye catcher
510	3365	So many people stop and look at the Vibe
510	3366	Has so many neat items that all work very well
510	3367	AC works great, heater is great, wiper at the rear window is great, heater in the back window is helpful on a cold day to see things with the rear view mirror
510	3368	Has a great radio and a jack to enter ones own music
510	3369	Well all I got to say it is a great or nice car for almost anyone.
511	3370	I just bought this vehicle a week ago and so far I like it
511	3371	Low road noise compared to my old Civic and the seats are MUCH more comfortable - I can't feel the springs beneath the fabric like I could with the Civic even when it was new
511	3372	Steering not as tight as I'd like
511	3373	I like that it has the height of a truck with the feel of a car
511	3374	"My elderly father can get in with minimal ""step-up"" and can get out very easily"
512	3375	This is a great looking car
512	3376	I got lots of compliments
512	3377	But the car simply has the worst ride of any vehicle I've owned
512	3378	My Toyota Camry rides way better
512	3379	I'm going for the second time to the dealer to see if anything can be done, but I'm not confident
512	3380	I can't see myself driving this car for three years-I'd get rid of it tomorrow if I could
512	3381	Very, very disappointing.
513	3382	I ordered this about 2 weeks ago; it is being custom built for me by Ford
513	3383	The deal was amazing
513	3384	Great price for a great truck
513	3385	I have some upgrades from the king ranch and platinums I test drove; I am getting the dvd headrests and the dealer is obtaining a lexan roll-up bed cover, which all pickups should have
513	3386	"We ordered the white sand tri-coat metallic and the 20"" KR wheels, navigation/Sync and moonroof"
513	3387	The whole thing is a luxurious work truck that does a fair job of passing as a limousine
513	3388	Wonderful blend of technology, industrial design, strength, beauty and versatility
513	3389	I compared this to Dodge, Chevy and Toyota
513	3390	In the end, the Ford had the best combination and the best $.
514	3391	Have had just over a week, have 550 miles
514	3392	Took it to ski for a week at a resort 125 miles away, it handled the slick roads at the resort with no problem (4WD) the v6 is very good,and it's nowhere near broken in
514	3393	"The 6 speed tranny is wonderful; smooth shifts, timing is great and will get better as it ""learns"", I'm told"
514	3394	Mileage on first trip, to, from and around the ski resort was 23.4 mpg, all in cold snowy weather
514	3395	"You're not supposed to love anything that can't love you back, but at this point, I'm in serious ""like"" with this Ford"
515	3396	I read all the reviews and I have to say that the G8 GT is all that I could have hoped for
515	3397	Mileage is unbelievably good
515	3398	Through the old miles driven divided by gallons used, my lowest tank has been 18.4 while the highest was 24.9(all highway, 70- 80mph)
515	3399	I look at the computer's mileage, and it's close, but usually higher than actual
515	3400	The power is addictive
515	3401	The car is quiet quiet quiet ! Fit and finish are really good, doors close with german exactness
515	3402	This is a driver's car, it doesn't come with tons of gadgets that you don't need, about the only thing I've missed is my auto dimming mirrors
515	3403	The car is a hot rod in family disguise...love it...
516	3404	Have had car for two days
516	3405	Traded in a Camry Hybrid for more than I paid for it 8 months ago w/9k miles on it and couldn't pass on the opportunity
516	3406	The Camry Hybrid averaged 35 miles per gallon and was a bit uncomfortable, not fun to drive, and most of all I felt that the current hybrid hoopla will soon be looked upon like a fad as new technology is introduced
516	3407	"The '09 TSX gets ""near"" what I got with the Camry Hybrid, but is more fun and the intention is to drive it to 150k+ miles like I did with my 97 TL (my 03 MDX has 80k miles on it)"
516	3408	Have two small kids and the backseat, of course, has slightly less room than the Camry - biggest con, but expected longevity and drive make up for it
517	3409	I have owned a 2002 ram ( 5.9), a 2005 nissan titan, 2007 ram ( hemi ) and now a 2009 big horn package
517	3410	the titan was the fastest truck i owned until I drove the new one, the power is GREAT
517	3411	I love the ride on this truck, going over rail crossing used to upset the back end of the 2007 ram, but not in this truck, its great that they finally made an interior to compete with Ford and Chevy
517	3412	I cannot believe how quiet this truck is compared to others that i have owned, diving down the interstate at 80, there is no wind noise at all
517	3413	Stickered at $41K and with all rebates i paid $31K and got $500 dallors in accessory cash, so I installed running boards.
518	3414	I love driving this car! We purchased the 3.8 with the tech package & tinted windows
518	3415	It got great mileage on a recent trip
518	3416	Enjoy the quiet ride
518	3417	Definitely a luxury vehicle
519	3418	Traded a Chevy for a new Ford
519	3419	This has the luxury for the needed night out and the toughness expected
519	3420	The SYNC is great
519	3421	I love the truck
519	3422	My only problem, so does my wife...
520	3423	I recently purchased an '09 6i Touring with the 6 CD changer & moonroof, along with a rear spoiler
520	3424	"My 2004 Mazda 3i was totaled so I wasn't in ""car buying"" mode, but I'm glad I stayed with Mazda"
520	3425	I went with the 4-cyl, which is starkly different than Edmund's review of the V6
520	3426	The ride is very quiet, and I get good gas mileage (1600 mi, ~24mpg combined.) The acceleration is great, most noticeably between 50mph - 75mph, even in auto
520	3427	The braking is excellent too
520	3428	As nimble as my 3i was, I feel like the 6i has excellent handling for it's larger size
520	3429	I've also fit 4 grown adults in the car, and they've all commented how much legroom they have
520	3430	Mazda got it right again! 
521	3431	After looking at several van and SUV models from various manufacturers, I narrowed my choices to GMC, Toyota, Honda and Chrysler
521	3432	I wanted a Hybrid vehicle, but also desired 4-wheel drive for the winter weather
521	3433	The Chrysler Aspen Hybrid was the perfect choice
521	3434	The driving is smooth
521	3435	I average 20 mpg around town, which includes some interstate driving
521	3436	The vehicle is solid with all the luxury features one would desire
521	3437	My model has all available options.
522	3438	Ok I was so happy at first - never owned a car this nice......never judge a book by its cover they say....it has been in the shop for brake sensor recall, warped rotors X3! MIGIG crashed
522	3439	Now it's sitting in the driveway the past month pending Lemon Law for the rotors
522	3440	Us brakes and rotors people got to find each other and DO something about it
522	3441	We paid alot of hard earned money for this vehicle! Everyone else - don't buy one....just say NO!
523	3442	Of all the xDrive BMWs I've owned or even driven, this one is a sublime blend of sure footed panther and raging bull
523	3443	Fit and finish is above even BMW standards
523	3444	It feels like it's hand made on the inside and looks like it was left behind by advanced intelligence from another galaxy
523	3445	Drove both engine sizes and went with the big one 5.0 V-8
523	3446	The roar alone justified my decision
523	3447	The slack-jaw looks it earns from the ignoratii are priceless
523	3448	Forget about cargo space
523	3449	This is not for soccer moms
523	3450	This is for a single individual to get out and have fun quickly
523	3451	Sport package is a must on this car
523	3452	So is Technology package
523	3453	Logic 7 premium sound is a hedge against any conversation
523	3454	Get 1
524	3455	I am happy I purchased this car because I love the way it looks and drives
524	3456	Very practical
524	3457	Lots of compliments from retirees
524	3458	Car looks like it costs a lot more than it does.
525	3459	I've always been a SUV guy, but with rising gas prices I started taking a look at a few of the larger sedans on the market
525	3460	The 09' Maxima trumped all the other contenders..
525	3461	hands down
525	3462	Fun to drive, decent gas mileage (about 20 mpg in the city so far), very comfortable, and it turns a lot of heads
525	3463	I opted for the base package that includes a moonroof, power seats, 6 disc changer, 18 inch wheels, and cloth seats (although they are more like microfiber)
525	3464	Test drive this car, you will not be disappointed!
526	3465	For a 19yo 6ft 210lb person i found the car very comfortable
526	3466	I love the styling and it looks fantastic when cared for
526	3467	I did find the e-brake under the armrest odd, however not really a problem
526	3468	I drive very aggressively and still get great gas mileage
526	3469	Coming from my previous vehicle (2003 Aztek) it is extremely fun to drive
526	3470	It preforms pretty well, however dogs slightly until you get to 40+ mph
526	3471	This can be alleviated with affordable after-market parts such as performance exhaust and intake.
527	3472	Really fun and peppy ride
527	3473	The only problem I have is with the driver's seat
527	3474	"I'm 5'8"" and find the seat extremely uncomfortable, digging into my leg underneath and my foot falls off the pedal to the right"
527	3475	To be expected for a compact car I guess
527	3476	I wonder whether it's just me or if others are having similar experiences with the car seat? Also, there is no visibility in the front or back
527	3477	Parking not easy.
528	3478	Just purchased the 2009 Pebble Beach edition
528	3479	Very reliable vehicle
528	3480	The navigation system is easy to use and access while driving (all touch screen)
528	3481	Very powerful car, good acceleration
528	3482	The backup camera is a nice feature, but the images appear farther than it actually is
528	3483	Have no problem driving in sleet/snow/ice thus far.
529	3484	I got my 2009 Tig in may of 2008 before better deals were to be had
529	3485	Oh well..
529	3486	I love the car itself
529	3487	It has been great and I get complements on it all the time
529	3488	People stop me to ask about it
529	3489	I sometimes wish I would've splurged and gotten the one with the sunroof
529	3490	The car is great in city and hwy and I'm amazed at how well it insulates outside noise
529	3491	Feels very solid throughout
529	3492	I agree with some comments about the black upholstery, it is a hair magnet
529	3493	I had an issue with a faulty fuel pump which was quickly replaced under warranty
529	3494	That's been the only issue I currently have 11K miles in the Tig.
530	3495	A very nice new and fresh design
530	3496	Very comfortable
530	3497	Excellent features like the sync, vista roof and refrigerator
530	3498	Perfect for taking the grandkids on weekend excursions
530	3499	Ford - keep up the good work
530	3500	Build the right car and people will buy it - what a concept! I have already influenced three others to but this vehicle
530	3501	Do I get a commission? or a key chain? Regards, Jeff B Dorough
531	3502	I have been driving my new TSX for a week now and love it
531	3503	Acura did a great job of making the most popular features standard (Xenon, Bluetooth, etc)
531	3504	The car has more than adequate pickup and handles very well
531	3505	It also has a nice back seat
531	3506	We test drove the IS 250, A4, G35, and S60/60
531	3507	The TSX has the best combo of space, size, features, and performance of the group
531	3508	The TSX's motor is superior to that of the IS 250 and A4 IMO
531	3509	It has similar real world performance capabilities and gets better mileage
531	3510	It is a very refined little car
531	3511	Perfect for us
531	3512	The IS and A4 were too small in the back seat and don't match the MPG--I am getting 29.7.
532	3513	I got the SL package on my 2.5S and am only mildly content with the performance vs
532	3514	options compromise I chose
532	3515	Having only owned previous 8 cyl
532	3516	cars (Last was a Continental), the change to 4cyl has been an adjustment to say the least
532	3517	Ride is great, styling and value are better than Accd/Camry/Mazda6
532	3518	Power is acceptable; but, wish I got the 6cyl
532	3519	Still think the mileage for either is great.
533	3520	Had this car for 24 hours and I have buyers remorse due to horrible road noise coming into the car
533	3521	It doesn't happen on every pavement but on most
533	3522	The noise is just horrible
533	3523	The pavement near the dealer is new and so the noise was not noticeable there
533	3524	I don't recommend this car for the price.
534	3525	We just picked up our new patriot 09 limited, sun and sound package on 8/5/09 and noticed our 1st leak (water pouring out of the front Dome Light) about 2 weeks later (1st rain storm)
534	3526	Come to find a Recall was issued by Chrysler on 8/7/09 for the same issue
534	3527	Everything else is great about the jeep, but i've already had to take it in to have the leak issue looked at
534	3528	Dealer claims to have resolved the issue by clearing a drain in the sun room
534	3529	Judging by the many online posts on this issue, the same leak or a new one is likely to return
534	3530	I would suggest that if you are in the market for a new patriot, to at the very least take it through the car wash a couple times on the test drive.
535	3531	This is my 3rd Toyota 4x4 pickup (also had 86 and 93 4Runners and 01 Sequoia)
535	3532	Still driving a 91 4 cyl, 5 speed 4x4 and traded off a 04 Tacoma for the 09
535	3533	By far this 09 is the best! All the elements have come together in a great pickup
535	3534	Ride is exceptional, power and performance outstanding under any conditions and it looks good too! I have driven city, highway, off road, good and bad weather and this pickup has not disappointed! I have the TRD Offroad PKG (can't live without my 4x4) with Towing
535	3535	Interior controls are easy to reach and read with a quiet ride for a 4x4
535	3536	Toyota, thanks for continuing the tradition of best in class 4x4!!!
536	3537	I have, up to now, been a loyal Honda Accord owner, but after a terrible experience with a vibrating 2007 V6 EX Accord, I finally traded for a 2009 V6 XLE Camry, and I am totally satisfied with my decision-even though it cost me $3000 dollars to trade out-worth every cent
536	3538	The Camry is awesome, quiet, powerful engine, good looking, well laid out interior, and it does not vibrate and shake like the Accord did! The 440 watt JBL stereo system sounds very nice, and the bluetooth option is way cool
536	3539	A recent road trip at speeds of 75+mph achieved 29.5 miles per gallon! And when you want to accelerate, hold on! There is a reason for so many of them are on the road - drive one - oh what a feeling!
537	3540	This car feels bigger than it is
537	3541	The ride is exceptional for something so small and while we are not huge people, there is room enough for even a large person
537	3542	The back seat is very comfortable for two
537	3543	Three might be pushing it
537	3544	Fun to drive and handles nicely on our twisty turny up and down roads we encounter daily
537	3545	Gas mileage, 27 to 33, has been above expectations and will only improve as it breaks in
537	3546	I would recommend this car to even good friends.
538	3547	I drive it like a Mustang
538	3548	"I put 20"" chrome wheels on"
538	3549	I drive 60 miles per day, half highway at about 80 mph
538	3550	City driving is fantastic, electric motor up to 40mph 4 wheeel drive cuts mpg but I average 28 mpg for the 600 miles driven 
539	3551	I like the car overall well enough
539	3552	Quality is good
539	3553	The only problem I have noticed so far is the tracking at highway speeds is a bit loose - that is, it wanders off desired track easily and steering is a little twitchy, especially in even a slight cross wind
539	3554	I haven't driven it enough to develop an opinion about the gas mileage, reliability or other operation aspects
540	3555	Very solid performance, smooth riding, good brake, good acceleration
540	3556	However, I found the building quality is not so good
541	3557	We've owned the car since November and continue to be impressed with it more as time goes on
541	3558	Fun to drive, plenty of power, front seats are excellent, built tight, looks great, lots of extras, terrific value for the money
541	3559	At 50 years old, I've owned well over a dozen vehicles in my life and this Fusion is my favorite by far
541	3560	It's a welcome suprise after all these years.
542	3561	The last car I owned that was actually fun to drive was a 1988(?) VW Jetta
542	3562	This car may not be quite in that class but it's hella more fun to drive than the trucks and SUVs I've had over the past 20 years or so
542	3563	My reliability rating is based on only 1 week of ownership, but so far so good
542	3564	Since nothing has gone wrong, I give it a 10.
543	3565	After one week it's a very good car
543	3566	Economy is good as SUVs go, but too bad it's not even better
543	3567	The cylinder shutdown feature works as advertised, and doesn't really interfere with driving
543	3568	Ergonomics in the driving position are excellent
543	3569	The electronics are really good, and the sensors help with maneuvering at low speeds
543	3570	Room is very good in back (why we bought it in the first place).
544	3571	For something with the aerodynamics of an apartment building, this thing is a nice ride
544	3572	It's exceptionally quiet, even over marginal pavement or at higher speeds
544	3573	Seats are extremely comfortable even after several hours of driving
544	3574	Interior is very roomy - even the 3rd row
544	3575	I had a 6-foot co-worker back there, and with the 2nd row shifted forward slightly, he said it was comfortable enough for a cross-town jaunt
544	3576	Engine has a enough grunt to cruise very nicely at 90MPH
544	3577	Ride is smooth with minimal body roll on turns
544	3578	The build and design are typical Honda - everything's well laid out (overall), and controls and surfaces have a good tactile feel - some minor styling quibbles (IMHO.) 
545	3579	Owned BMWs for 11-yrs; got tired of expensive fixes
545	3580	The Mazda has creature comforts not typically found in this class
545	3581	Leather, heated seats, remote starter, Bose upgraded stereo, 4-wheel disc brakes
545	3582	Very fun to drive, way better looking than anything in it's class (Honda Fit, Corolla, Civic)
545	3583	Fuel economy could be better, but a small price to pay with all the features and drivability
545	3584	The interior fit and finish matches BMWs I've owned
545	3585	I researched cars for about a week solid before purchasing and nothing comes close to the bang for the buck
545	3586	The one major complaint - the horn sounds like something from a clown car.
546	3587	I love this car
546	3588	It has great looks, ride, and mileage
546	3589	I tested the Accord and Mazda6 and the Altima was a better car for me
546	3590	I still don't understand why no lumbar support for the drivers 6way on the S series and why 9 cup holder?
547	3591	 After 90k on my '06, I just bought an '09
547	3592	(The '06 is still in the family, and my previous Legacies have made it to the high 200ks with one at 330k - without major repair.) I felt the ride on the '06 was hard & sharp, but the '09 has smoothed that
547	3593	I feel it is still firm - not soft like the review stated
547	3594	The driver's seat position has always given me more room than I need (6'1)
547	3595	"Although I like the outside ""look"", I'm one of the few who felt the '06 was original and creative (Alfa-Romeo comes to mind)"
547	3596	Now it looks like a Chrysler
547	3597	"As for interior space, if you need more room, buy a ""box."""
548	3598	Have had this car about a month with 1800 miles on it and I love it
548	3599	It's the best of both worlds, you can just cruise or drive it hard and it responds flawlessly no matter what! The 7AT helps with the gas mileage and is fun to drive in the manual mode! Coming from a Maxima I expect the same reliability as well.
549	3600	This car has made my parting with my 17 year old SAAB 9000 Turbo 5M a lot easier than expected
549	3601	The looks, sport ride, electronics, etc., etc., are outstanding
549	3602	It's so quiet I have to watch my speed!! The 4 banger with the 6M is a great match
549	3603	The thought that has gone into the interior lay out is impressive
549	3604	"I am quickly bonding with my ""baby blue""."
550	3605	Overall car is fun to drive, the performance is what you would expect from a BMW car
550	3606	The appointments in the car are first class, but there is one thing that I see lately, which has frustrated me, and many other people on the Bimmerfest forum's...that is a terrible whining noise coming from the transmission or differential....drives people crazy !!! I seen the same issue now on 5 Series and 7 Series cars, and BMW doesn't seem to care about this, but it totally frustrates many people that have spent a lot of CASH!!!
551	3607	My old SL Saturn has been showing signs of dying for years, so I hit the internet looking for a new replacement
551	3608	I stumbled upon the Fit completely by accident, but fell in love with it after reading several reviews and the specs on it
551	3609	As of Jan
551	3610	"27, I've been having a blast with my new Blackberry Sport and it just seems to be getting better! Driving to work is fun again, fuel economy is fantastic, and with all I can do with the back seat/cargo area, I'm set for just about anything! I will admit the price was a bit much, but just over 5k after, this was the BEST investment I could have made! To quote the commercial, ""The Fit Is GO!!!!"""
552	3611	Bought my MDX 4 months back
552	3612	After 2 months transmission fluid started leaking, noticed oil marks on my garage floor
552	3613	Took to dealer - they had to open the whole transmission and check inside
552	3614	"The problem was a faulty ""O"" ring which was causing the leak"
552	3615	If a $20 part is faulty after 400 miles not sure what to expect from this SUV
552	3616	The dealer had to remove the whole transmission, unlink it with the engine, opened up everything connected to the engine to get to the faulty O ring
552	3617	Don't buy this car, for this price there are much better options in the market
552	3618	I have Lexus SUV as well and it far exceeds Acura from performance and reliability.
553	3619	These are concerns expressed on this blog that no longer exist in this vehicle
553	3620	Flash to pass is on this vehicle and it works with the HID high beams, I believe an industry first
553	3621	Bluetooth is standard
553	3622	It is now impossible to step on the brake and gas pedal at the same time
553	3623	There is a single address book for the Bluetooth, navigation and OnStar systems
553	3624	I compaired this vehicle to a Infinity 37x, Acura TL, and Lexus GS 350
553	3625	All are excellent vehicles
553	3626	Only the CTS DI AWD has the interior luxury of the Lexus (done in the distinctly GM style), the performance and efficiency of the direct injection engine (it runs on regular gas) and handling characterics of a European sedan.
554	3627	Shopped for a new car for 3 years
554	3628	We knew we were going to get a Subaru, and settled on the Forester, but ended up with Tribeca because of the size of the back seat (can sit between two large carseats comfortably), and a great deal on this model
554	3629	Initially was not interested in Tribeca because of the high octane fuel requirement, which apparently changed this MY
554	3630	Took on its first long road trip, and so far has been extremely comfortable and fun to drive
554	3631	It has everything we were looking for in a long-distance vehicle
554	3632	The safety features are certainly a great selling point
554	3633	There aren't many options/accessories that we feel are missing
554	3634	Nice, solid vehicle!
555	3635	Just purchased it
555	3636	Torque if fantastic
555	3637	Best when merging into the highway
555	3638	Cabin ergonomics are top rated
555	3639	The whole family loved it
556	3640	As a Honda fan since 80 (first Civic) and having gone through every model since, I was pumped to get rid of my 95 accord with 240K on it
556	3641	My search of reviews indicated the 09 Accord coupe was a good buy
556	3642	Then I bought it and reality set in
556	3643	The car constantly hunts between cylinders and when not on cruise control and is the most irritating thing I have ever experienced
556	3644	Perhaps it is the letdown from my emotional attachment to Hondas
556	3645	While I like everything else about the car, the VCM constantly changing speed trumps all that - and therefore DO NOT BUY
557	3646	I love to support my American Cars but when I got a job traveling the east coast I opted to buy a Honda Accord
557	3647	Recently our company forced us to use rental cars and we are stuck with this malibu
557	3648	After driving around 500-680miles on a tank of gas to going to 400-475miles I was less than impressed
557	3649	"I'm 6'4"" and this car is less roomy than my Accord.I feel extremely cramped while i'm sitting here typing this headed to florida from North Carolina (co-worker driving 1st shift)"
557	3650	The car looks nice and runs well
557	3651	Interior not so pretty but its a rental so I'll suffice
557	3652	The radio is lacking features also
557	3653	Steering is much sloppier than the accord
557	3654	It does have a smooth ride too.
558	3655	Since buying the car in early October we have put about 6000 miles on it, including a 4500 mile trip from the Central Coast of California to South Padre Island, Texas and return
558	3656	I kept careful records on the trip to Texas and my overall mileage was 33.8 mpg
558	3657	Understand that many of these miles were at 75-85 mph across West Texas, AZ and NM
558	3658	It is a great driver, long days on the interstate were comfortable
558	3659	On a twisty two-lane mountain road in New Mexico it showed that it is not a BMW, but I knew that
558	3660	The trunk is more than adequate carrying two carry-ons, a small duffle, and other items
558	3661	This car is a technological marvel.
559	3662	We have enjoyed the Jeep GC Limited diesel
559	3663	Outstanding power with great mileage per gallon
559	3664	Could not ask for more bang for the buck than this new 2007 Jeep
559	3665	Fit and finish excellent
559	3666	You need a category for the diesel!
560	3667	I like the car a lot
560	3668	I really enjoy driving it
561	3669	I bought the black on black fully loaded, every option version and couldn't be more happy
561	3670	I am married with two kids and this is the perfect blend of family and sports car
561	3671	You will not be disappointed.
562	3672	What's amazing about this 2.5 all wheeler is the fact that on a trip from Colorado to South Dakota in my first month of ownership, I averaged 33 mpg highway and 28 mpg city
562	3673	For all wheel drive, this is spectacular mileage in a quality vehicle
562	3674	No rattles, very little wind noise, all the bells whistles I need and then some.
563	3675	I purchased this car just over a month ago
563	3676	I absolutely love this car
563	3677	I've been a Chevy fan a long time, but admit in 2005 I strayed and bought a new Honda because Chevy at that time didn't provide what I believed to be a quality product in a car
563	3678	This car is absolutely one of the best handling, best looking, best built cars I've ever driven
563	3679	I have the 2.4 cylinder, but the performance is as if a 6 cylinder is under the hood! It is so quiet, sometimes I can't believe it's running
563	3680	I love the looks of the instrument cluster, very nostalgic
563	3681	I love driving the car and have to literally pry it away from the wife to do so, since it's her car
563	3682	I am glad I came back to Chevrolet.
564	3683	Wanted to downsize a little from my 2007 Acura TL-Type S
564	3684	Test drove an 2008 Fit to see what was all the hype
564	3685	It was great
564	3686	Couldn't wait for the 2009
564	3687	Went to my local dealer and put a deposit on one even before they came in..
564	3688	the car was that much in demand
564	3689	Glad I did
564	3690	It is amazing
564	3691	Not as fast (or flashy) as the Acura, BUT, it is so nimble and just plain fun to drive
564	3692	The folding rear seats (up and flat) allow for an AMAZING amount of room! Don't miss the Acura at all
564	3693	Average just around 37-38 mpg in city driving..
564	3694	and sometimes I really push using the paddle shifters :-)
564	3695	Test drove many cars before I settled on the Fit
564	3696	Easily outclasses ANY car in its class
564	3697	Get one!
565	3698	We've been happy with our Pilot
565	3699	We're hooked on the XM radio, love the dual zone climate controls and are very impressed with the overall room of the interior
565	3700	We were looking forward to having the class 3 trailer hitch, but were sorely disappointed with the fact that just the Honda trailer wire harness is $181 dollars for a 2 foot harness under the bumper(?!)
565	3701	Even more disappointed that the connector under the bumper is a goofy connector that NOBODY carries yet
565	3702	Happy over all though
565	3703	We'll just wait to buy a harness from someone not trying to rip off a customer for an overpriced set of wires
565	3704	Happy with the handling, but our Pilot pulls to the right on level ground at constant speed
566	3705	I'd strongly considered the new 335d sedan earlier this summer, but opted for the 335i sedan instead...primarily due to availability and price considerations
566	3706	This is my 6th BMW in the last 20 years, and I'm in love all over again with my car!! The sport package is worth the price, and the new IDRIVE nav system is much improved over the 2006 model.
567	3707	Took the new car on Vacation
567	3708	We love it
567	3709	The car drives great
567	3710	The elevated seating is awesome
567	3711	The Sirius satellite radio is great
567	3712	Good MPG
567	3713	The Chill Zone is cool
567	3714	We love the car
567	3715	There is nothing else like it out there
567	3716	The Fit is El-Cheapo compared to the Caliber
567	3717	The Vibe is nice, but no options at this price
567	3718	I would recommend a test drive
567	3719	It is one great car
568	3720	I am really enjoying our new Mazda5, but I am not overly amazed
568	3721	It is a very small mini van
568	3722	Our small, umbrella stroller doesn't even fit! I know we will out grow this soon, but it is fun for now.
569	3723	Overall the car seems to be an excellent value
569	3724	My only concern and something Hyundai doesn't seem to be able to resolve is the IPOD port
569	3725	I have connected 3 different IPODs in and none worked
569	3726	The only music that played was some MP3 songs no Itunes
569	3727	I went to my local dealer who couldn't resole the issue I contacted Hyundai directly and the response I got was to go to another dealer to have them look at it, even though that dealer is over 50 miles away
569	3728	So still no answer to why the IPOD port doesn't work.
570	3729	I purchased a brand new 2008 Ford Edge back in March 2009 and I love the car
570	3730	It feels like a real car
570	3731	Its performace is awesome and not to mention its outside and inside design
570	3732	Even my wife wants to drive my car more often than her Honda Pilot
570	3733	The Sync system is great and if you are into technology, you will enjoy it even more
570	3734	I must say that Ford really scored a 10+ on this one.
571	3735	I tested more than 15 cars, including Lexus IS, BMW 530, Audi A6, Mercedes E350, Infinity M45, Jaguar XJ8
571	3736	None are better than the Genesis! The quality is awesome, the car is solid & extremely quiet, the performance is great and the price is low for what the car offers! It has all the features of a twice as expensive car + 5 years full warranty
571	3737	The interior is as big as Lexus LS and BMW 7 series and the quality is just as good! I?ve been driving it for 1 month now and I can?t find any flaws
571	3738	The snobs might say: ?it?s a Hyundai?, but this is how Lexus started as well
571	3739	Unless you?re willing to pay $20-30k more for the brand name to buy a similar car, you?ll be impressed with the Genesis! 
572	3740	I have 10k miles on my Sonata
572	3741	I have not had the first problem
572	3742	MPG is great
572	3743	Even with my wife's heavy foot, the car still gets 24mpg in town and we get 32 on the highway loaded down for a trip going 70mph
572	3744	My GLS did not come with the auto on/off headlights but you can still leave the headlights turned on all the time and they will go off when you turn the engine off and remove the key
572	3745	If you have BMW taste then do not consider this car
572	3746	But if value means more to you than people judging you by the coolness of your car, then the Sonata is for you.
573	3747	I recently traded in a 1999 Chevy Tahoe LT for a new 2009 LTZ model
573	3748	The much reduced pricing and 0% interest made this an easy decision
573	3749	I am very happy with the new model and the significant improvement in ride quality and technical advances over the previous model I owned
573	3750	The miles per gallon has improved by about 15% over the old model, 16 mpg is achieved now with a 50/50 mix of highway and city driving
573	3751	The bluetooth cell option automatically turns down the radio and ventilation noises to permit an easy conversation
573	3752	It is easy to store telephone numbers and make cell calls over bluetooth
574	3753	When driving my new Mazda 6(I've had it two weeks) with the rear windows down there is severe buffeting and air pressure that caused the eardrums of three of us to hurt even though we only were subjected to this phenomenon for about 10 seconds
574	3754	Never experienced this in any car I have ever owned
574	3755	Anyone else have this problem? If so, what did you do? Did you call Mazda and what was their response? Also, I calculated the mileage I got driving locally and it was 23.7 MPG although the car's computer indicated 18.8 MPG
574	3756	I really like my Mazda 6 overall with the minor exception of the buffeting issue noted above.Ha 
575	3757	I tried several small SUVs and decided that the Escape was the best for me
575	3758	Others had visability issus, headrest issues and even the ease of getting into the back seat
575	3759	I travel from Santa Cruz to Lake Tahoe and have grandkids with me
575	3760	I don't get the gas mileage that they say (26 highway) as I am only getting 22.7 at best and I am not a speed demon
575	3761	Even driving alone I don't get the gas milage
575	3762	So I may trade in sooner than I ever planned for another Escape
575	3763	Others seem to be getting the better gas milage
575	3764	I would also like to see the front seats maybe an inch or so longer in lengh
575	3765	I am only 5'1 but it seems short even to me.
576	3766	This car is quiet and fun to drive
576	3767	I love the DVD system with the wireless headphones for the kids
576	3768	The interior space is not much smaller than my Ford Expedition that I traded in
576	3769	I actually have more cargo room while all 7 seats are up than before
577	3770	If you're looking at the RX 350, then I don't need to tell you about reliability, fit and finish, etc
577	3771	I picked up my 2009 w/nav a few weeks ago and I'm coming from a 2000 RX 300
577	3772	Prior to that I've owned about 15 other vehicles - Toyota, Honda, Nissan
577	3773	I drove the FX and the feel was much more sporty
577	3774	However, the trunk space sacrifice was unacceptable
577	3775	I've driven the 2004-2006 and I wasn't convinced that the improvements to my 2000 were worth the premium
577	3776	However, in 2009, I can say that they are
578	3777	Ive been very impressed so far with this car
578	3778	The price was great for such a reliable car
578	3779	It is not only reliable but can be quick and great on gas
579	3780	We have had our van for one week now and just got back from a long road trip
579	3781	After trading in a 2003 Dodge Grand Caravan we had an idea of what to expect from a new Chryler, but we were pleasantly surprised
579	3782	The new van has vastly improved entertainment options and interior quality
579	3783	My boys have had a lot of fun rotating the 2nd row seats to face backwards and challenge their brothers to video games on the third row video screen
579	3784	Meanwhile I have enjoyed listening to Sirius sattelite radio in the front without having to listen to the sounds of race cars and explosions from the rear
579	3785	We had 138000 miles on our last van
579	3786	We were very happy about the unlimited powertrain warrany
579	3787	Good!
580	3788	This was purchased for my wife and she positively loves it
580	3789	She's owned two Chevy blazers and this one wins hands down
580	3790	Handling, fun good looking vehicle
580	3791	The only thing I can think of that she does mention is she wishes the back window would open for better convenience
580	3792	A little louder but you give up a little quiteness for an suv
580	3793	(road noise)
581	3794	This is a fantastic car! I can't complain about anything at all
581	3795	I've never liked a car as much as I like this one; it's fierce!
582	3796	Favorite car I have ever owned
582	3797	Considered and test drove many other high end cars, but wisely chose the FX
582	3798	It's an eye catcher on the main roads, and a performing BEAST on the back roads!
583	3799	I love the look of this car
583	3800	I was always a fan of them and finally purchased my first pony this year
583	3801	The outside is awesome and the v6 engine is especially peppy being a 4.0
583	3802	It is not great on gas, but I do average in the mid-20s on the highway
583	3803	the interior is fairly cheezy
583	3804	the glovebox is pretty small (my old Dodge neon had a larger and more functional glovebox) and the center console is also kind of impractical, but all around it is more of a sportcar than anything else, so it is nothing to really get picky over
583	3805	also they used a lot more cheap plastic than i would of liked
583	3806	all around, i would purchase it again, and love it tho
584	3807	I have always owned Mustangs ever since high school and boy did that change when I saw the new Challenger
584	3808	I had just got a 2004 Cobra the car of my dreams, or so I thought
584	3809	One thing I never really cared for was that Mustangs were so small and had no room for family, they also rode a little ruff after a while, definitly not a dailey driver or for road trips
584	3810	We went to the dealership and they had one left, they wanteed 42, but I talked them down to 34, wich is good considering I live in Cali
584	3811	My wife was hesitent but after we took it to Oregon to break it in, she fell in love with it
584	3812	As much as it weighs, this thing is still fast, and so smooth at the same time
584	3813	Such a head turner.
585	3814	I have driven 30,000 miles in the deserts of Las Vegas and get 22 -23 MPG aroung town and 26 - 28 on the highway
585	3815	I have had the services done and am sitting at the dealer having the 30 mile service performed as I write this
585	3816	Th rear brakes need to be changed at $270 and the front are still 80%
585	3817	All the tires are still good
585	3818	30,000 miles and the front brakes are at 80%, this is awesome
585	3819	Look up brakes on the Toureg and you will see every 15k to 20k miles at 4 times the cost of the Tiguan
585	3820	This SUV has been flawless, you cannot go wrong
585	3821	I test drove the CRV and love the looks, however, the interior seemed cheap and the ride was not as quite
585	3822	I cannot praise the vehicle enough.
586	3823	I traded my 2008 Nissan Rogue SL AWD ater 21K miles for this Tiguan SE 4motion because of the better features, ride, handling, acceleration, and build quality.The car is the best engineering product I have found in the market today for the money
586	3824	VW truly is the best kept secret in terms of quality,features,value, and fun to drive
587	3825	I got my X5 less than a week ago and I love it
587	3826	I saw the 2010 iDrive on a couple of other BMW models
587	3827	I became afraid that I bought too soon before the 2010's came out
587	3828	Hey this car handles awesome and is super comfortable
587	3829	The fat wheel looks burly
587	3830	I like the electronics and computer stuff
587	3831	Sound system is way better than I expected, and I am a picky guy
587	3832	I'm tired of Mercedes Benz and the way they treated me
587	3833	When I got the X5 my blackberry connected easily with the bluetooth
587	3834	With Mercedes, blue tooth only worked with Motorola and Verizon
587	3835	That stinks, they went out of their way to make things more expensive and harder
587	3836	BMW beats Mercedes in handling and steering in my book
587	3837	Bye bye BENZ.
588	3838	Down sized from a luxury SUV
588	3839	First benefit is the average MPG for my first week of 29.4! Great styling, performance and comfort
589	3840	"Excellent vehicle! I've never been a ""Label-looker"" so I shop for the goodies at a reasonable price"
589	3841	This car delivers and then some
589	3842	The ride is comfortable yet responsive
589	3843	The interior is ample
589	3844	I'm built like an NFL defensive end and I'm very comfortable
589	3845	The amenities are numerous, you get a lot with the standard package
589	3846	I have the Premium Plus and I'm very happy
589	3847	The trunk is spacious
589	3848	The V-6 290 bhp engine is as smooth as butter on a hot muffin and you can cruise at 80 mph without nary a concern
589	3849	An All-Wheel drive version would be too sweet! The stereo system is very nice, audiophile worthy
589	3850	"A great buy if you're into affordable luxury and you tend not to follow the ""label""."
590	3851	Probably one of the quietest cars in it's class
590	3852	Stunning with the 19 in chrome wheels
590	3853	More storage than I could ever use
590	3854	I love the green LED floor board lights, handy if you drop something
590	3855	A fun car to drive...love that Auto Stick...I'm used to rowing my own gears
590	3856	Cool the way the middle seats pop up and forward out of the way
590	3857	The wide opening door are great getting grandma in and out but you must watch the kids opening them to far in tight parking lots
590	3858	Overall I love this car
590	3859	Waiting for the Chrysler version.
591	3860	This is one hot car
591	3861	From the exterior design, to the interior comfort to the superb V6, this car delivers
591	3862	I'm averaging 24.8 MPG in combined city/hwy driving
591	3863	I'm averaging a shocking 27.3 on the hwy using the recommended 93 octane
591	3864	The engine is tuned for nothing less than 93 octane fuel
591	3865	I love the handling, the fit & finish are excellent
591	3866	Take one for a ride
591	3867	Then wait and do it again
591	3868	Then decide for yourself
591	3869	You won't be disappointed
591	3870	Really.
592	3871	I am in love with this car
592	3872	My Fusion is Tuxedo Black
592	3873	It looks amazing
592	3874	It rides beautifully
592	3875	Sync is just incredible
592	3876	Your IPod plugs right in for Sync
592	3877	You don't even need the six CD changer
592	3878	It handles well
592	3879	I feel so safe in this car
592	3880	I have test driven the Camry and the Accord and this car just blows them out of the water
592	3881	I have never felt this way about any car I have owned in the past.
593	3882	If you took the bowties off this SUV you would not believe it is a Chevy
593	3883	My wife and I are very impressed
593	3884	It was a leap of faith to order one without actually seeing one like it and driving it
593	3885	We are not disappointed
593	3886	Maybe I am too much of a Chevy man with some bias, but this is one great vehicle to drive and ride in with excellent build quality
593	3887	We got the LTZ in Black Raven (I think that is what it's called) and it has some metallic it in
593	3888	Beautiful especially in the sun
594	3889	I now have 15,000km on my dodge journey SE
594	3890	So far, so good
594	3891	The 4 banger is not that powerful but I did get it for the gas mileage (which is great on highway!)
594	3892	Still has pick-up and I don't find it too noisey
594	3893	Curious how it will be long term though
594	3894	I am happy with the Journey and will let you all know if problems start.
595	3895	If you want reliability and economy, you choose the right car
595	3896	If you want a luxury car with bell and whistles - forget it
595	3897	I love this car for the gas mileage and reliability
595	3898	I get anywhere from 33 to 36 miles a gallon 50/50 city and hwy driving - mostly no air conditioner
595	3899	The car is noisy with hwy driving
595	3900	I recommend getting the power package for the four door sedan (I have manual doors)
595	3901	It can be a hassle unlocking and locking all the doors when you have passengers
595	3902	I use this car for work, so I needed a reliable car with good gas mileage
595	3903	The seats are OK, not very comfortable, but good enough
595	3904	The engine is peppy, but going up steep upgrades is a little difficult
596	3905	Performance-enough to keep me satisfied
596	3906	Styling-nothing too dramatic but it does stand out
596	3907	Interior-6' 200lbs guy here, more than comfortable
596	3908	Quality-right materials used in all the right places
596	3909	MPG's-runs on 87 octane and averages 27-28 city, can't complain! Haven't hit the highway yet.
597	3910	WOW, Bring back the E-Body Mopars with all we loved Plus
597	3911	Add stopping, turning, reliability, gadgets to my old 71 Cuda and you scratch the surface of what this car is
597	3912	Although a little porky due to all the gadgets and safety equipment, this baby still performs well
597	3913	The car gets more attention than anything out there and in case someone didn't notice stomp on it and the 6 speed version roars loauder than the auto since the suitcase muffler is deleted
597	3914	The car handles well and the performance gauges show some of my roadcourse results with 0.99 lateral acceleration
597	3915	Thew car seats 5 so my family of 5 can fit for some cruises or to shows without the need of a 2nd vehicle
597	3916	Car is AWESOME
598	3917	I bought my car on July 30th in Minnesota, and drove it 350 miles over the weekend, and 900 miles back to Colorado yesterday
598	3918	I'm coming off of a BWM 328xi lease, so this is a step back in many ways, but BMW is too expensive right now
598	3919	They wanted $30k for a buyout! For less than $19k, so far I'm feeling really good
598	3920	I got Black, and I like the exterior styling
598	3921	With tinted windows, it's a sharp car
598	3922	I also like the tan leatherette interior - nice contrast to the Black
598	3923	The quality of the cabin is excellent
598	3924	Performance is pretty darn close to my 328xi from 0 to about 40, but then it lags the BMW
598	3925	And I miss 6 speeds
598	3926	Overall, a solid car, but will it go in the snow?
599	3927	I've had the tig for a week
599	3928	What a joy to drive! Tiguan just won the highest safety rating in crash tests
599	3929	Amazing acceleration for a small SUV
599	3930	If you like German styling, engineering
599	3931	Don't wait
599	3932	This vehicle delivers
