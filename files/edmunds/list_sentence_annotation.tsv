6	44	Side mirrors reverse tilt down can be switched OFF, trunk has push button right above license plate (slightly to the right).	3
7	46	I love the power the V6 provides	4
7	48	"I got it in black with the 17"" rims and love the way it looks!"	2
8	49	The body of this car is by far the best looking on the road today	2
8	50	And Deep Sea Blue is the most beautiful color I?ve seen	2
8	51	In the shade it looks black, but in the sunlight it?s a gorgeous three dimensional metallic shade of dark blue	2
8	53	The conclusion: the car has awesome lines regardless of color	2
10	67	Truly, I thought I would give up a lot to save gas and the environment but instead was quite surprised! Got the hybrid fully loaded and couldn't be happier	0
11	69	The car is beautifully crafted with subtle elegance	2
11	70	The AWD worked superbly in snow and ice	4
15	97	MPG avg is 41 mostly highway but a little mix	0
18	115	Lot's of fun to drive, and nearly as versatile as a minivan	7
18	116	Seems to be very well built	3
19	123	Honda states they are having battery problems	4
24	150	We have the Limited V6 with everything but GPS	3
25	155	Fun to drive	7
25	158	Only slightly smaller in back than my 4runner	3
25	167	Gas pedal seems to be on wrong angle for me (6' and slim)	3
25	168	Right foot hurts if I drive highway too long	5
25	170	It is a slick looking car	2
26	178	more comfortable	5
28	197	The power & acceleration is outstanding for this small 1.5L engine	4
30	204	After our third came around it was time to move up in terms of size with our vehicles	3
31	212	The ML interior is great compared to the others	1
32	221	Take the build quality up a bit, and you get a new Ford	3
32	222	The car feels like its built very well	3
33	228	Altima appearance to me is far superior inside and out	2
35	243	However, all of the other interior details make up for this shortcoming	1
35	244	The engine is very responsive and the CVT is seamless	4
35	245	You can't even feel the car shift!	5
38	260	Not to mention that it is more fun to drive	7
41	276	I get plenty of compliments and makes me feel happy to drive it	7
41	278	Once you're higher up, engine feels like it struggles to move up, nevertheless it's fast enough for me unless you're looking for a speeding ticket.	4
42	283	This became uncomfortable even during a short drive; during a long trip it would be unbearable.	5
43	284	Style is obviously good	2
43	285	But the interior (radio and environmental) is not that impressive	1
43	288	The leather seems pretty cheesy	1
43	289	If you put something lightly heavy on the seats it show an indentation forever	1
43	294	At night the interior lights do night dime enough	1
44	301	The 6 cyl has better performance and had a better response time	4
45	307	It really is a great value compact SUV for the money, not to mention the Honda reliability	6
50	335	My wife and I enjoy driving this car	7
51	343	A/C works like a champ, and cools the car in about a minute with fan speed initially set at 3	4
51	347	The engine runs cool.	4
53	363	People stare at it when we stop at lights and restaurants	2
54	369	The Hemi-Orange is a real standout and gets attention	2
54	371	Slower than the old 426, but does get up and run	4
55	382	The new 09 Forester is a perfect size for my small family	3
57	400	The seats are very comfortable	5
58	408	I'm having lots of fun driving this baby around	7
59	416	My kid can enjoy the cartoon network 24/7 now	7
60	420	It has run down protection so the battery should never go dead	4
62	430	Just goes to show you how much space it has.	1
63	437	Turning radius makes it easy to handle	5
63	438	Seating comfort and room is 100% better in 2009 than 2008.	5
65	451	Was driving it again and slowed down to turn a corner and it died for no reason	4
68	464	This is one of the most fun cars to drive	7
69	475	I enjoy driving it.	7
71	487	The car is plenty peppy and a lot of fun to drive	7
73	497	The engine is strong for a 1.8 liter and has ample pull with a smooth transmission	4
75	506	I could not stand the uncomfortable seats any longer	5
75	507	The headrests bothered me because they would push my head forward no matter which height they were at and the seats were rather hard and the lumbar support did not provide much satisfaction	5
75	510	The seats are much more comfortable and I no longer have back pain when driving.	5
77	525	My only major gripe with the car is the interior	1
77	527	I think it is the worst interior off all the cars competing in this segment	1
77	528	The interior of the Audi, Benz, Lexus, and Cadillac is a lot better	1
78	531	My wife and I are getting older so we wanted comfort, which the Flex excels at for both short trips around town and long trips when we visit our grandchildren 300 miles away	5
85	582	Build quality is unparalleled	3
85	588	Much more comfortable truck than previos models	5
86	594	Since the adoption of the car, I have been stunned every day by 1.8 liter engine's peppy performance on free way	4
86	595	I couldn't figure out how the small engine has the great power, compared to my previous 8 cylinder coupe	4
87	602	For the first time in a long time, it's fun driving to and from work	7
87	604	It corners, accelerates, hauls, and pulls a landscape trailer like it isn't even there	4
87	606	Plenty of interior storage space, even though it's a regular cab	1
88	611	Only thing I would do different is get the car in Black and get the Nav	2
89	615	Handles great, comfortable on long drives, and have no major issues with the car so far.	5
97	648	The leather is fading inside already - car is garage kept	1
98	655	The controls are very easy to operate and make this a very convenient vehicle	5
99	665	The engine is very responsive in all situations	4
99	666	Breaks are also responsive without being too touchy	4
99	668	This model comes well equipped and avoids including many of the useless bells and whistles other SUVs have	3
101	678	I recently took this vehicle on a 6 hour road trip and I was actually in pain when I arrived at my destination	5
101	679	The driver's seat is rock hard and has very little leg and back support	5
101	680	If you have leg and back problems, please think twice before purchasing this vehicle.	5
102	683	That being said, it's all about performance in the RDX, and a fun factor that you will not find in any other smaller SUV	4
102	684	The RDX is the best driving small SUV out, it's faster, handles better, and has fantastic steering - new editions like the Q5 will give it a run, but its price keep it from being shopped together.	4
105	704	This car is heavier perhaps that explains why it feels more solid than it's competitors	3
107	714	The interior space is surprisingly big; I mean, I knew everybody talks about the cargo space, but as a passenger you do have lots of room to play with	1
107	715	It has a nice turn to it, it is a smooth drive.	5
114	757	I get back pain, and my passenger gets neck pain from the head restraint	5
119	804	The dealer had aftermarket leather installed on the seats, but gave me a great deal on this car	1
121	816	Overall the outer styling is top notch	2
121	817	The interior is nice but leaves room for improvement	1
121	824	This motor does take a bit to rev up but then the power kicks in	4
121	825	By no means is this car fast from the stop, if you want that get that Raliart model	4
123	833	Other than the lack of a little power over the hemi this truck is light years better than the Dodge in every other way	4
123	837	This makes it just a little uncomfortable however nothing you couldn't get use to	5
125	844	A/C works great and cools down the car within a couple of minutes	4
127	856	This car is so much fun to drive	7
127	859	The ride is comfortable, although my wife prefers the cushier seats in her Lexus	5
132	880	I knew this car would be fun to drive, but I didn't know that I would think it would be the funnest car I think I've ever even been in	7
132	890	Comfort is nice	5
132	891	I sometimes drive 250 plus miles at a time and never think once that my legs or back is getting sore	5
133	896	None compare with the comfort and goodies that come with this one	5
135	909	I really like the reliability of Hondas	6
137	917	Its quite a sight to see the engine temperature gauge go from 190 to 260 within 3 minutes	4
141	943	Not only is driving a manual again after a decade's hiatus great fun, but doing so in this pocket rocket is even more exhilarating	7
141	944	Still under the 600 mile break in period, so I rarely take the rpm above 6000 rpm, yet still, this machine shows tremendous spunk off the starting block	4
143	951	"1 mudguard has a 4"" diameter hole clear through it"	3
145	961	I did have to replace the OEM tires after 4200 miles due to wear, but other then that the car has performed better then I expected	4
145	962	The car is FAST but also drives well on the highway for normal cruising	4
146	972	If you like music, then you'll esp love it	7
149	984	I am as comfortable in this car as I am in my Silverado Pick-up	5
152	1002	The exterior designed is powerful and I love the way it drives! 	2
158	1035	Low-end torque is a little weak, but the turbo makes for a zippy little passer once it is underway	4
160	1045	All that stuff works great, but the seats are not as comfortable as my E350 was	5
160	1047	I do 70% freeway driving and at 65 mph, this motor has limited passing ability	4
161	1056	Great visibility	3
161	1058	Beautiful interior	1
161	1062	Fun to drive	7
163	1078	It gets around town very well, the freeway drive is comfortable	5
163	1079	The audio sounds good, and AC cools well	7
163	1080	The steering wheel is a little touchy, but that could be me who use to own a 96 Mercury	5
168	1114	Excellent build quality overall and no problem whatsoever so far	3
169	1119	We recently took it on a 1200 mile road trip loaded up with 2 adults and young child very comfortable although the door armrests are annoyingly low	5
174	1153	While not as luxurious or powerful as my old Audi, it's hard to believe this car can be had for under 26k	4
177	1174	It clearly is a well-thought out vehicle and very much fun to drive	7
178	1177	Just a sweet looking car that is super fun to drive	7
182	1196	Great car overall, but the clutch pedal is a bit too heavy for regular city stop and go driving	5
184	1211	I love the car, it is quiet, low road noise	5
185	1218	I previously owned a VW beetle which I loved but it was getting too costly to own - so I went w/a Toyota mainly because of the reliability of the company	6
187	1232	And performance is great! I am very pleased with the car...except for 1 thing---the headlights dim just a bit about every 15-20 seconds when the AC is on	4
187	1234	However, this is not a big enough problem to keep me from loving my car!! Honda's reliability is excellent.	6
188	1239	I do wish that I could have a little more power	4
189	1243	The door rubber seals need to improve, if you open the driver door you can see poor wilding Pocket left and right Pumpers (front _ down) which can store dirty wet material, need to add protection screen for the tires to protect the SUV both sides from (splash) 	3
190	1245	I'm glad I did because it performs better than expected	4
190	1246	I priced other trucks in the same class and found this new F- 150 has a far better exterior	2
192	1263	Exterior has great lines with chrome accents and the cocoa metallic finish is beautiful in the sunlight	2
197	1291	Familiar with Toyota quality and reliability	6
197	1292	Car looks awesome! Super White looks fantasic	2
199	1309	Soft ride with lots of pep and no hesitation	5
201	1327	Beverages in the chill zone, snacks under the floor and movies playing on the DVD	7
203	1340	It's zippy and I am very comfortable on highways	5
204	1346	If you select a black one, only use microfiber cloths on the exterior and say good-bye to automatic car washers	2
209	1382	It is much sleeker in design although it is still Rather bland	2
209	1384	The seats are comfortable but not quite up to my 2002	5
210	1392	Comfy seats	5
210	1396	Even outperforms the 170hp v6 in my '98 626LX despite being much larger car	4
215	1431	It is noticeable, causes nausea	5
218	1451	A lot of thought went into this design!	2
220	1461	Exterior styling is edgy without being too trendy and should hold up well over the years	2
220	1462	Interior styling is simple and elegant, and mostly very high quality (but what's up with the thin vinyl on the armrest and the Buick velour on the door panels??)	1
224	1478	I needed a rear seat for my child (unless I could leave the wife home more often)	1
229	1511	I am impressed by the engine and DSG transmission	4
229	1513	However,at very low speeds there is too much engine braking due to no fluid coupling so some small amount of lurching is sensed	4
229	1514	The interior is very attractive and seems well made	1
229	1515	The only complaint thus far is the front seats which are too hard	5
230	1518	Kids love the Rear Seat Entertainment, iPod connection and awesome sound system	7
232	1529	It allows me to keep my eyes more on the road, by not having to look down as far to see my speed	5
232	1532	It has the typical Honda suspension that you feel the road bumps and hear the road noise	5
232	1533	It is fun to drive	7
233	1536	Vehicle drives smoothly and I receive many compliments	5
233	1538	It has hot heat and cold a/c	3
233	1540	Really love the placement on the digital speedometer	1
235	1552	I now have 3000 miles on the odometer and the car has performed flawlessly	4
236	1559	It provides a very smooth ride with all of the practical needs	5
236	1561	It is extremely quiet	5
246	1626	Someone told me I'd just bought a $32,000 iPod accessory (which may have a grain of truth)	7
248	1643	Not too big, not too small; perfect size for someone who doesn't live in their truck	3
251	1656	I plan on driving it to Arizona all the time from Vegas, it is so comfortable too, GM did a great job with this car	5
255	1676	lots of room for other friends and family	1
259	1701	The 6 speed trans is silky smooth	5
260	1709	The brakes are very touchy	5
261	1715	The Camry has brought daily sanity back to driving what with European Style gas prices	0
261	1716	I have cut almost $400 dollars per month in my monthly fuel bill	0
261	1718	The Camry is comfortable but not too much like a boat	5
263	1730	Moroccan leather interior and sunroof included	1
265	1740	We just picked up the '09 6 GT to replace a leased Ford; all around, it's better/more fun to drive than our '08 Accord	7
267	1753	Honda civic provide a better grip on the road and fun to drive	7
268	1763	It has plenty of power, with excellent cornering and braking	4
269	1768	The quality of the interior materials is far beyond that of some of its competitors, namely the Toyota Corolla	1
270	1774	The kids did not fare well in the back	5
270	1777	My tallest in class kids are not likely to fit in the back for long	5
271	1789	The interior is a bit spartan but very well thought out	1
273	1799	This is my third Honda, and all have been amazingly reliable	6
273	1800	Not all of them have been fun to drive, however	7
273	1801	My new Si takes the fun level off the scale compared to most other Hondas	7
273	1802	Are there faster cars? Yes	4
274	1813	I get a lot of AHHHs from my co-workers when they look at the interior styling	1
274	1814	I bought a bright silver exterior	2
274	1816	Not so with darker colors, in my opinion	2
274	1817	The tail end looks fabulous!! Definite BMW 7 series resemblances	2
274	1818	Very powerful acceleration	4
274	1819	Great control over rainy roads with the SH-AWD	4
275	1823	I find the engine to be quite capable and powerful for both city and highway driving	4
279	1852	While not the most powerful car, it delivers what it needs to in most situations	4
282	1870	Road noise is horrible on certain roads	5
283	1872	I drove the the Camry and Accord when shopping--the Sonata has a much more comfortable ride	5
285	1883	Great ride, very comfortable and quiet	5
285	1888	This engine and tranny is silky smooth and quiet, everyone comments on that who has been in the truck	5
286	1895	It is impossible to take this car on anything more than a half hour drive without feeling your arms are going to fall off!!!	5
287	1899	BMW just not as comfortable	5
287	1900	Seats not as supportive	5
287	1903	Passenger seat grinds/clicks when moved	5
288	1914	Excellent acceleration, braking and handling	4
292	1934	I keep changing colors and haven't yet decided which is my favorite yet	2
294	1942	In addition, it is very comfortable and quite quiet on the highway	5
295	1950	It was comfortable on the trip	5
296	1960	Overall just a great truck that can fit four people comfortably on long trips.	5
300	1990	Material could be a touch better in the MDX (the black fiberglass trim looks cheap for example)	3
301	1997	Then I learned that remote start is a problem	6
302	2003	Lease was up on my 2005 Highlander V6 Limited which I enjoyed	7
302	2007	Can't believe the smoothness and quiet cabin which is my #1 priority	5
302	2009	Didn't take any adjusting from driving an SUV to a car which I thought I'd feel	6
303	2014	Pros: Body style is distinctive	2
303	2024	Cons: Front seats shaped weirdly, not the best comfort	5
303	2027	Auto trans shifts in and out of overdrive too often	6
304	2032	My other vehicle is F-150 V-8, but this little 4 banger (4 cyl) really has the power, I can't imagine a V-6 in this thing	4
304	2033	It only has about 870 miles so far but it really goes fast, I have to watch my speed to keep it under 70 mph	4
304	2035	Up hill and down around sharp curves it was great, power was right there better than my F-150 V-8	4
304	2036	Gas mileage is outstanding..	0
304	2038	my average is 28.1 mpg	0
307	2058	Did not need extra stuff like 4wd or navigation or high end radio	4
307	2060	Rides very smooth on highway	5
307	2064	Interior looks sharp	1
308	2068	Beautiful and comfortable interior	1
308	2070	(Can't understand why anyone would want the 8 cly.) I did not order the tech package, but bought a Garmin instead	4
309	2073	Luckily, my 12mpg Infiniti QX56 has been traded and this 2009 Acura TSX is the replacement! I just wish I bought one of these before	4
309	2075	The Acura TSX beats both, in every way, by a mile!	4
313	2092	It has 9,000 miles and has only been back to the dealer to have a sunroof put in and for oil changes	6
313	2094	The fuel economy says 24, but if you don't drive hard, I easily have cleared 27-28 in the city	0
314	2099	Nevertheless, the Forester beats its competitors? handling and demeanor	4
314	2104	AC is more than sufficient for Texan heat	6
314	2106	Positively surprised by fuel consumption (comparable to old Focus)	0
315	2107	I have been pleasantly surprised at the fuel economy and pep	0
315	2109	I was apprehensive about buying a four cyl., but the six speed trans really gives it great performance; it feels very peppy and is really fun to drive	4
318	2124	Back seat seat belt connector very rigid, difficult for kids to buckle w/ booster seat	5
318	2125	Not great maneuverability in parking lots	4
318	2126	Fuel mileage in city is much less than estimated - highway is good.	0
319	2129	The styling of this car is amazing	2
319	2133	If you are looking for a great performing, look at me style vehicle for a great price, this is the car for you	4
320	2143	Interior fit and finish is xlnt	1
320	2144	I'm 6'4'' and have plenty of leg/head room, compared to most Japanese cars	5
320	2145	There's enough bolster in the cloth seats for those curves, but still very comfortable for my daily commute to the city.	5
321	2146	No reservation with the 09 Scion I am delighted with the buy, would of love a 5 speed shift but its my work car and the reason for purchasing the car was for economic reason	4
321	2149	The 2.4 engine make the Scion get and go, economy of the car is really see at the low speeds, the automatic trans could use an additional gear, keeping the RPMs around 1.8k when on the highway and would make the Scion that much more economic for highway use, but with a tight engine I got 315 miles on the first out of town trip	4
321	2150	Please do not misunderstand the Scion is good on gasoline	0
322	2152	The trunk has room for all my golf clubs and the split seat works well for my fishing rods	5
322	2157	The seating position can fit all, I'm 5'11 with long legs and it's really comfortable	5
325	2168	Extremely powerful and handles very well	4
326	2177	I expect the same reliability and longevity	6
328	2189	Gas mileage is good, but the on-board gauge is off	0
328	2191	Still good, but instrument is unreliable	6
329	2197	The gas mileage is not very good	0
330	2207	I have never driven anything so smooth and quiet, you can't even feel the vehicle shift	5
330	2208	It provides excellent sound barriers from the outside	5
330	2209	The seats and ride are so comfortable and the leg room is perfect for the taller population	5
332	2217	Beautiful in camel pearl	2
332	2218	Comfortable leather seats	5
332	2222	Comfortable ride	5
332	2225	Happy, happy, joy, joy.	7
333	2227	You have to be really delicate to avoid the car spinning like crazy when you start	6
333	2229	So at the end it dissapoints because the engine is great and the DSG gearbox is amazingly smooth but the car is not sitting on the road as it should and can become dangerous because of the big torque it has for its size.	6
338	2253	Checked out the Mazda6 with the 4 cylinder and thought it was a nicely appointed car but the power was not what I expected	4
338	2255	Wow what a difference, I was sold as soon as I hit the acceleration	4
340	2261	I've been enjoying the car very much	7
340	2262	"It's fun to come out of stores and have guys standing around the car and saying ""that's a Hyundai?"""	7
341	2274	The turbo is great	4
341	2278	The backseat is way better than the Infiniti (an adult can actually sit upright), but it's still a pain to get in and out	5
342	2280	I went from 15 MPG to 38.6 MPG I drove from the DC area to Johnstown, PA over the weekend	0
342	2281	The trip is about 220 miles one way going up and down mountains and cruising up there at the speed limit +5 on cruise control I got 38.6 MPG	4
343	2288	This crossover is so quiet, it is riding in your living room	5
344	2292	It is tremendously smooth and it has a ton of power	4
344	2293	It certainly ranks up there with all the other luxury SUVs out there without being priced as high	5
344	2294	The interior is roomy and comfy while the exterior is just flat out hot	1
344	2296	Push button start is nice but I don't like the fact that I can't listen to my music after it is off	7
344	2297	The traditional turn key allowed me listen to my music even with the car off as I can turn the key about three forth of the way	7
344	2298	Also wished the aux input was not located behind the center console	6
344	2299	Can't comment on the fuel economy as my Murano still needs to break in.	0
345	2300	 Month and 7k miles, I love this car, it is my favorite	0
345	2301	The car is easy to maneuver, great to park	4
345	2302	I like driving it in manual mode, where I can control the shifting and make it smoother	4
345	2303	It is good on auto but I prefer the manual specially since there is no clutch	4
346	2305	This my second Honda Accord and so far I love the car but hate the brakes	6
346	2306	After one day and 75 miles the steering wheel developed a very bad shudder when braking! I called the service manager and he said to drive the car at least 1000 miles before I bring it in? I am now at 950 miles with an appointment for next week	6
346	2307	The steering wheel shudder is still present on moderate and above braking	6
347	2309	Have owned car for 3 months, very stylish outside	2
347	2310	Have LT1 version, interior seats are very nice though a bit uncomfortable especially for your lower back	1
347	2311	No carpet in the back seats, basically a big floor mat latched down	5
347	2312	I get 20.2 MPG	4
347	2313	My biggest problem with the car is the location of the oil filter	6
347	2314	I have changed oil on dozens of vehicles (new and old) but never had to change the filter from the top of the engine	6
347	2315	There is not enough room to place a filter wrench on the filter, it took 3 hrs for 3 men to unloose the initial high torqued filter by hand	5
347	2316	When the filter was loosened it went all over other components located underneath the filter	6
347	2317	Otherwise a great car and roomy.	5
348	2321	Here's why: Fun to drive factor: there's no question that this car will be putting smiles on our faces for years to come	7
348	2322	Our 13 year old son even says it looks cool	2
348	2323	On some back roads in Talledega Forest, this car begged to be driven fast...80+MPH is where this car feels best	4
349	2327	The lift gate is great and at the right height to the ground and the space is more than ample.	5
350	2328	Very nice! Drives great! Definitely turns heads	4
350	2329	My opinion the black is the best looking of them all	2
351	2331	I added sunroof and leather seats	2
351	2333	Comfortable to drive	5
351	2334	Power from the 2.4L 4 cylinder engine is fine for everyday driving and results in the following gas mileage	4
351	2335	24~26mpg around town, 32~38mpg at 55mph, 29~30mpg at 70mph	4
351	2336	"Even though this is a gas sipping green car, I like the agressive styling including 17"" chrome alloy rims"	2
351	2337	I have someone ask about it just about everytime I stop for gas, especially from owners of big SUVs.	6
352	2339	I replaced a Hemi Durango so I was hoping for better fuel milage	0
352	2340	So far this thing rocks	7
352	2341	plenty of power with great manners, and lots of room for a 6'3 guy	4
352	2342	Brakes are a little weak for such a light car	6
353	2344	Ride and comfort are excellent	5
353	2346	The Tech package is outstanding, we love it	4
353	2347	The ride improvement is excellent	5
353	2348	Drove the 4-wheel version, yes it has more HP and is faster but you give up the smooth ride for the firmer sport ride	5
353	2350	The seats are better than Lexus	5
353	2351	The rear leg room is much better than the 06	5
353	2352	I do miss the blue dash lights that was in the 06 TL	2
354	2356	"Moved to the top of a very steep ""second gear up"" hill 2 years ago and wanted AWD"	4
354	2357	Have had the Forester for 2 months and the quality seems to be quite good	4
354	2358	Snow season passed prior to purchase, but have driven my sister's 2007 Forester in the snow and it was a transcendent experience	6
354	2359	Handles well in corners and on highway	6
354	2360	Highway MPG is about 28	0
354	2361	Engine isn't a powerhouse during hill-climbing around town, but no complaint here with such good MPG figures.	4
355	2362	I bought this car 5 months ago to replace an SUV so was not sure about sitting lower to the road	5
355	2364	The drivers seat raises, giving me some of the height I used to enjoy	7
355	2365	This car is just fun to drive! Pick up is great, handles well	7
355	2367	I have not had a chance to try out the AWD yet, but if my current satisfaction is any measure I know I will not be slowed by any snow!	6
356	2369	Vehicle initially worked fine for first month than began to shake violently when going into EV mode	4
356	2372	"First said it has ""learned"" my driving habits so it won't drive in EV the second claims EV does not work when the air conditioning is on (doesn't seem to work with it off) 6,000 miles on it and am ready to unload it"	4
357	2373	I absolutely love my car! This car looks hot(even better with tinted windows)	7
357	2374	I thought that the R/T offered quite a few options for very little money	4
357	2376	engine won't beat anyone off the line, I do get about 24 mpg	4
357	2377	The ride is very smooth and the car is fun to drive	7
357	2378	There is a blind spot to get used to and the chrome around the gear shift can cause a glare, but otherwise I like the chrome look	2
357	2379	I enjoy having Sirius radio and I love having the radio controls on the steering wheel (a feature I thought I'd never use!) The interior is extemely roomy and there is a lot of trunk space.	5
358	2383	The mileage is greatly overrated, at least in my view	3
358	2384	I have not achieved better than 18-19 MPG	0
358	2385	It dos not shift very well and remains in lower gears too long	4
358	2386	The ride quality is equally overstated	4
358	2387	I feel every bump and pothole	5
358	2388	It is a smooth ride only on well maintained roads	5
358	2389	Otherwise the ride is very harsh	5
358	2391	I have noticed rattles and noises even on minor bumps	3
359	2393	Perfect car to travel with because of its cargo arrangement options and seating space	5
359	2394	The comfort of the passenger seat was of utmost importance to us	5
359	2395	The seat is broad enough, has enough leg room, and recline capabilities so the passenger has positional options during a trip	5
359	2396	However it has one defeat-if books or grocery bags are placed on the front passenger seat the seat belt signal sounds	1
359	2400	Wish the width of the back cargo space immediately behind the back seat was the same as at door area.	5
360	2401	Outstanding engineering, safety, and quality	4
360	2405	Fun to drive	7
360	2406	Getting 34 mpg at 70 mph	0
361	2408	Its a great little car for the price, I haven't had it very long so I cant say to much but its turning out to be a fun car to drive.	7
362	2411	We also looked at Kia Rondo, but we don't like the look of the car and the fact it doesn't have the sliding door	2
362	2412	We got a base model 5 and installed after market navigation system and DVD	1
362	2413	After market DVD player looks much nicer and takes a lot less space	1
362	2415	And this is the only car my wife actually loves to drive	7
363	2420	Fit and finish are excellent, mileage is amazing (24.5 in the city, 34.5 on the interstate at 80MPH with the air conditioning)	4
363	2422	Most comfortable sedan I have ever owned	6
363	2424	After 3800 miles, I've had no problems whatsoever	6
364	2426	In the last year I've experienced a complete engine failure due to spun rod bearing (as have 100's of others US and abroad), driven with an intermittent CEL for 2 months and been to the dealership 4 different times to have the problem resolved, I have multiple issues with the factory ECU tuning including a severe occasional hesitation, and about a dozen other manufacturer defects and dealer workmanship issues including a damaged intercooler, multiple components installed improperly, multiple components not installed at all (missing bolts, etc), and the vehicle now makes a wide array of abnormal noises	4
364	2427	Was fun to drive when it was running properly, but trust me its not worth the hassle!	7
365	2428	I just bought my Fit yesterday and the whole family just love it! It is spacious and comfortable	7
365	2430	It has a great sounding stereo and the air conditioner will just about freeze you out	1
366	2432	I traded my Mercedes GL450 because we wanted something slightly smaller, but not give up the utility, and luxury-comfort	3
366	2434	It has sporty handling but is still luxurious and quiet	3
366	2435	Gets 20 MPG which is great in my book	0
366	2436	"I'm 6'4"" and 300 lbs and am super comfortable in it, and.."	1
367	2439	I've driven if for about 600 miles so far and I love it more each day	7
367	2440	It has everything I was looking for and more; good safety features, lots of cargo space, fun to drive, my tall friends say the backseat is much more spacious than expected and very comfortable	3
367	2441	I got the vivid blue color and it's awesome	2
367	2442	I also love the black interior but it does show anything left behind of the fabric like lint from clothing	1
367	2443	I would suggest the sports package (sunroof, 17 inch alloy wheels, and heated seats)	1
367	2444	I'm getting on average around 24-25 MPG (mostly city driving).	0
368	2446	This is an Autobahn with 6-speed and shifts like a dream	4
368	2447	For some reason the rear hatch washer leaks on the hatch window when open and leaks when the hatch is closed	3
368	2449	Per tech, installed Tiguan check valve and the thing still leaks washer fluid	3
369	2452	Happy to have the AC and the ABS, no radio though	6
369	2453	I got 400 miles on the 13.2 gallon fuel tank, not too shabby and that is with the AC on and in a lot of stop and go traffic	0
369	2454	Looked at the Yaris but it was more expensive and not as comfortable or quiet and considerably less roomy	5
369	2455	The Honda Fit was also less comfortable and less roomy plus more expensive	5
369	2456	The Versa may not be flashy looking but it covers all the bases and then some	2
370	2457	Even though the car had good reviews, I didn't want to drive it because, well, it's a minivan	3
370	2458	So glad I saw it in person	5
370	2459	"It's so much cuter than a big ol' behemoth ""mini"" van"	2
370	2461	"I'm hauling kids to college in 2 short years and I wanted something small enough to park and maneuver, but with room for ""stuff."" I knew sliders were great for little kids, but it didn't occur to me until I took my mom to church how nice that access is for an elderly person, too"	3
370	2462	My in town mileage has been around 24.5 mpg	0
370	2463	"The ""auto"" climate control is taking some getting used to."	4
372	2468	The prius is incredibly economical and the advanced powertrain engineering is very clear	4
372	2469	"The interior space is exceptionally good, although at 5'11"" it would be nice if the driver seat could be moved and additional inch rearward"	1
372	2471	In town this Prius gets 53 MPG and for day to day commuting it handles well	4
372	2472	It is not a car that I enjoy driving fast, since at the limit of handling it is a little unsettled	5
372	2473	The turn radius is fantastic though, and it understeers predictably through tight fast corners	4
372	2474	The acceleration is similar to a mid 70s American sedan - it won't win any races.	4
373	2480	Styling is so much cooler and Sync and Audio is high tech	1
373	2483	Interior is excellent quality & design	1
373	2484	Middle row leg room is excellent	1
373	2486	I drove the FLEX 1st and was so impressed	7
374	2491	Handling is responsive and the car meets my needs very well	4
375	2495	The 4cyl has great pickup, quiet acceleration, responsive steering, easy stopping	4
375	2496	Ride quality smooth and tight, build quality tops	5
375	2498	While all were good I felt the 6 was the most fun to drive	7
375	2499	Also looks better than the competion.	2
376	2503	The steering is for a weightlifter--very difficult, hard	5
376	2504	The high seats on passenger side& inside trim at rear, make blind spots, you cant see the cars coming on the right side	1
376	2505	You ask--what about mirror? guess what, its so small, you can miss seeing traffic	6
376	2506	Seats are very cheaply made, w/hardly any padding for comfort	5
376	2507	And guess what---no glove box lock, or light to see, figure that	2
376	2508	I was appealed by this car, by its looks, not as a car & don't want anyone to do this stupid action	2
377	2511	BMW 335 gave me the best driving experience in terms of acceleration, handling, brakes, and comfort	7
377	2513	I bought the G37 because I got 6 grand off MSRP and it's roomier inside	1
377	2514	I'm sure it's a lot more reliable than BMW.	6
378	2518	I get about 21 mpg in 90% city driving and about 27 on the hwy	0
378	2519	You'll be hard pressed to find a family sedan with AWD, a moon roof and this level of refinement for the price.	2
379	2522	I fell in love with the redesigned body style of the 2009 model, but that's where the love ends! The biggest complaint I, and many other owners that I have talked to, have with the 2009 Corolla is the Electric Power Steering	7
379	2523	I cannot, for the life of me, keep the car in a straight line when traveling over 50mph	7
379	2524	I think that it is a design flaw that should get looked into	2
379	2525	Other than that rather annoying and potentially unsafe aspect, the build quality is comparable with the 2004 model	1
379	2526	Gas mileage is about 35mpg.	0
380	2528	We were looking at everything from small hatchbacks like the Honda Fit and Toyota Matrix to full-size minivans such as the Odyssey and Sienna, but the Mazda5 seemed like the perfect fit for us: it has plenty of space for a small family (up to 2 kids easily; 3 would be fine until you have to go for a long trip), it's relatively sporty and maneuverable, and it's much more fuel- efficient than minivans	3
380	2529	The kicker -- it's the only thing remotely minivan- like that offers a manual transmission.	2
381	2532	Plenty of room, great road manners, quite and great warranty	5
381	2535	Very very happy with the elantra touring.	7
383	2539	This is a nice small - medium size car	2
383	2540	Has a very strong engine (for its category), a lot of space and it is priced better than the competition.	4
384	2542	This car compares to all except G37S which was fast and fun but rough ride	4
384	2544	The only thing that bothered me on test drives was the cooled seats (back hurt)	1
384	2545	Bought car without cooled seats	1
384	2546	Other then this I love the car - cool look and great ride! Very good price for the features and quality provided	2
385	2550	The ride, very comfortable, very smoothe, and enjoyable	7
385	2551	When you see it in person, it is really strange, it looks so small, like a rock or a toaster with wheels, but CAVERNOUS inside	2
386	2553	Very nicely laid out interior	1
386	2554	very Spacious with easy entry and exit from all seats	1
386	2555	Even my mother in-law (a very large woman) said it was easy to get into and out of the passenger seat and the second row	3
386	2556	Did not attempt the third row thankfully	3
386	2557	Decent acceleration and stopping is also good	6
386	2558	This is not a race car after all but a family transporter so set your expectations correctly and you won't be disappointed	4
386	2559	The sound and video systems are excellent! Usually do not even consider a Ford	1
387	2566	With the new one, I average about 27-30 mpg per tank (80% city & 20% hwy)	0
387	2567	I have standard stereo and the sound quality is very decent	1
387	2568	Overall, I'm very happy with the car.	7
388	2569	I absolutely love this car	7
388	2570	I got it loaded and it has all the amenities of a luxury automobile along with the sportiness	4
388	2571	I was shocked and sold when I sat in one and it was extremely comfortable and roomy	5
388	2572	Get a convertible or a sunroof because they operate great	3
388	2573	It gets great gas mileage and all maintenance and the entire car (Including paint and body) is guaranteed for five years	4
388	2576	What a wonderful car!	2
389	2581	It holds a large amount of stuff as well as 4 humans	3
389	2582	It handles well, is comfortable and we are getting 18 mpg in town and the promised 24 on the road	4
390	2586	Just want a reliable comfortable car with good MPG and got it	4
390	2587	So much room inside, it is really unbelievable - 350 lb	1
390	2588	passenger in back seat was very comfortable	5
390	2590	performance was great	4
390	2591	Plenty cargo room since interior so spacious	1
391	2592	I have been disappointed in this vehicle! The insulation in this vehicle is poor	3
391	2593	The heater works wonderfully but just about freeze my legs on the driver side	4
391	2597	I left my keys in the car and turned OFF yet in less than 3 hours my car battery was totally DEAD	4
391	2598	This certainly can't be a safety feature to have a battery lose charge this quickly	4
391	2599	I agree about the noise!	4
392	2600	I have the Fit Sport with navi in manual transmission - it has VSA and ABS	6
392	2601	It has excellent handling in the snow	6
392	2604	So I drove on streets that were not yet plowed, particularly on those with some elevation, so the car had to climb	4
392	2607	Not once did the wheels spin or slide - because the VSA corrected it immediately	6
393	2610	So far so good haven't had a problem with it yet	4
393	2611	I'm not sure about fuel economy though, I have the 4.0L V6 and I get 14 in the city	4
393	2612	I'm suposed to get 17 in the city and 20 on the highway	4
393	2614	Its the best one That you can buy for the money	4
393	2615	I wouldn't reccommend this truck unless there is only two people in your family	3
394	2617	The Audi A4 ride is fantastic; the 4-cylinder Quattro engine is very powerful	4
394	2618	Tiptronic manual shift is fun (but dangerous-- must be careful to avoid speeding ticket)! This vehicle is beautiful, roomy, and hugs the road	7
395	2621	Like minivans, my Vibe is practical and versatile	4
395	2622	Unlike minivans, the Vibe is economical and fun to drive	4
395	2623	But the Vibe GT is a few details short of perfect	5
395	2625	I lost some tight cornering ability but gained a whole lot more in noise reduction and comfort	5
395	2627	I had back-up sensors installed to allay fears that I would back into something or, worse, someone, such as the grandchildren who live with us	1
395	2628	I would have also appreciated an in-dash compass	7
395	2629	Still a great ride and purchase.	7
396	2632	This car was a reasonable compromise	6
396	2633	The seat is firm and surprisingly comfortable on a 500 mile drive	5
396	2634	The vehicle handles firmly and assertively unlike Toyota's other models	5
396	2635	I call it a vanagon; it felt large at first, but it really is more like a tall sedan than anything else	2
396	2636	I have a black one with that ridiculously toothy chrome grill, which seems to be a desirable feature on higher-end vehicles	2
396	2637	But it goes like a tank in the snow and hauls a medium amount of stuff	2
396	2638	Expect good resale from it and I feel safe.	6
397	2639	I wanted a compact car with good Gas mileage	0
397	2641	It's fun to drive	7
397	2642	It rides better than I thought it would	4
397	2643	and I get 32 MPG in the city	0
397	2644	I think GM finally has built a good compact car	3
397	2645	It has more pick up than I thought it would	4
397	2646	Not to good on a up grade but it's a compact car	4
397	2647	I only had it for about a month now and I don't think it has any blind spots in it	4
397	2648	The side windows are big	3
397	2649	The engine runs quiet and it has a good ride on the highway	3
397	2650	only one thing wrong with it, made in Korea	6
397	2651	If anyone wants a compact car they should take a good look at a Aveo.	2
398	2655	It has a good amount of power and the brakes are fantastic	6
398	2656	I drive it pretty hard, but I still get about 26-28 mpg doing a mix of city and highway driving	0
398	2657	"It's hard to explain, but the car just feels ""solid"""	2
398	2658	The doors close with a dull thud, instead of a hollow bang	3
398	2659	Even things like the turn signal lever feel well built	2
398	2660	The steering is tight and easy to maneuver, even at high speeds	5
398	2661	The ride is overall excellent.	4
399	2664	I don't have a lead foot, but I'm not always the most conservative driver and I'm getting 38 mpg doing about 30% city/70% highway	0
399	2666	As far as reliability, I believe it was consumer reports that put it in its top 10 list of reliable cars at #7 so that's definitely a good thing	6
399	2667	"Overall, I'm happy with the car and recommend it to friends when they say ""Nice bubble, do you like it?"""	2
400	2668	I researched many cars offering similar amenities	1
400	2669	The KIA appeared to offer better features for the lowest price	2
400	2670	I was not disappointed, it has great features and is very well built	3
400	2671	While not a powerhouse the engine offers sufficient power for highway driving	4
400	2672	The seating layout and flexibility is well done providing real flatbed storage	4
400	2673	The transmission is smooth	4
400	2674	I wish that KIA offered a larger tyre option, but it is not a major flaw	4
400	2675	The finish and engineering are of high quality	4
400	2676	The entertainment system, bluetooth and component inputs make offer more luxury features than are found on many prestige cars	4
400	2677	I was surprised and disappointed to find an ashtray, GPS space would be better.	4
401	2682	The Fit by FAR blew the competition away	4
401	2683	I have DOUBLED my mpg over the PT	0
401	2684	Cargo space is amazing, and have easily fit my two large greyhounds, and last week a 6 foot industrial clothing rack	1
401	2685	Have put 1800 miles on it in about a month	4
401	2686	Fit also made list of greenest cars	3
401	2687	Drove over a nail this week and the TPMS alerted me to low tire pressure	4
401	2688	Now I look forward to driving every day, instead of wondering if my car will start! 	4
402	2691	Averaging 28.5 MPG true Highway, 24 MPG Limited city, 21MPG City	0
402	2692	Overall very impressed with vehicle	6
402	2693	Drove the Camry and the Sonata blew it away in comfort and styling	5
402	2694	Only knock is slight hesitation in acceleration after decelerating	4
402	2695	Nav performs great and much smaller than most vehicles and touch screen a plus, Bluetooth has good performance	4
402	2696	The fit and finish is far superior than the 2008 Sonata	6
402	2697	Seats are very comfortable and dual zone temperature control feature is awesome although temperature seems to run a little hotter than actual	1
403	2700	The ratings I base on any car that's as fuel efficient as this one	0
403	2701	Much more fun to drive than a hybrid, yet gets nearly the same mileage	0
403	2702	Spacious, back seat fits adults, seats comfortable on a 1400 mile, three day trip	3
403	2703	Be wary of the hype that the car will get over 50 mpg	0
403	2704	Trying real hard I can get 45 - 46	0
403	2705	Around town I've been getting much better than I'd guessed, 38 - 40	4
403	2706	I have the manual and keep the car at 1500 rpms unless going uphill	4
403	2707	Never needs to be at more than 2000 rpms unless in top gear, passing or entering a freeway	4
403	2708	Averaging 70 mph you will be lucky to exceed 41 mpg	0
403	2709	It's in the constant 50s and 60s that 46+mpg is possible.	0
404	2712	It looks means and corners great	4
404	2714	I love the look of the interior especially the radio	2
405	2722	I am averaging 33 MPG living in the burbs! The XLE interior is wonderful and I am glad they came out with this trim for 09	0
405	2723	I was not looking for a fast car - my main priorities were: gas efficient, comfortable, reliable and stylish, and the Corolla covered all! I love the new body design for the 09 Corolla.	4
406	2725	When the new body style was released I fell in love	2
406	2728	I look forward to getting in my vehicle every morning, traffic or not she is amazingly comfortable.	5
407	2729	I had a Mercedes R350 with all the options, and I drove the Flex and looked at the price and said what the heck am I doing driving a Mercedes, I returned the Mercedes 5 months early to get the Flex, I could not find the SEL with leather and Nav, so I settled for the SE and will install the Nav	4
408	2735	I also hear the whining noise coming from the engine or transmission	4
408	2736	Sounds like the whining sound from a turbine, but the car does not have a turbocharger	3
408	2737	The sound varies at different speeds and engine torque	4
408	2738	Sometimes not very noticeable at all	3
408	2739	The seats are also hard comparable to competition	5
409	2742	The lancer drives very well	4
409	2743	It's as quiet as any of it's competitors, as corolla, etc	4
409	2744	It soaks up most of the bumps with minimum effect in the passenger car	4
409	2745	It's engine, a dohc with Mitsubishi Innovative Valve Timing and it's continuously variable transmission both work to make the ride pleasant	4
409	2746	I've had two prior generation lancers and they all were highly reliable, with minimum repairs and breakdowns under severe use	6
409	2747	The car is very safe and sturdy - uses very strong steel	6
409	2748	The only flaw is that the epa fuel economy is already below it's competitors and below the prior generation lancer 2007	4
409	2749	And when you drive it - it seems like it's below the epa estimates also - especially city.	3
410	2754	was going to pay for it but 0% financing-ok/ The car is really great-fun to drive-more than enough headroom-free Garmin-car loaded w equipment.Dont wait! good pickup and passing-26.8 mpg n town so far	0
411	2762	The line distorts viewing	4
412	2764	This is a well-engineered, solid vehicle at a reasonable price	4
412	2765	The vehicle provides better road visibility as it sits up higher than a sedan, decent mileage, and is flexible enough if we need to transport small stuff (e.g., chairs, boxes, etc.)	3
413	2769	The DSG transmission is the culprit and appears in all VWs-not onlyt he EOS	4
414	2775	My 1st choice was a Chevy Tahoe, but I wasn't that thrilled with the size and lack of cargo space	1
414	2777	Of all of the vehicles, Honda had the smoothest ride	4
414	2778	My husband and I are both very tall, and we fit comfortably in both the front and second row seats	1
414	2779	The gas mileage isn't great, but it wasn't any different in any of the vehicles we drove (I'm not sure why it is constantly brought up)	0
415	2781	Been driving one since 2003 and have no performance or reliability issues with the car	4
415	2783	I would assume these are common accessories today, especially the iPod	1
416	2787	There is not a car out there with a cooler combination of interior and exterior styling and it's really fun to drive.	4
417	2788	Bought this car for use as my wifes and myself commuting car and to keep the SUV in the garage to keep the miles off it and save some money in gas	0
417	2789	We keep the rear seats down and use the area as a cargo area	1
417	2791	We purchased an after market rubber mat that covers the complete cargo area (with the seats down)	1
417	2792	The car looks small on the outside, but inside there is a lot more room than you'd expect	1
418	2797	very nice drive, the tan interior looks great, smooth ride, no complaints about the car	1
419	2798	The 2009 Acura TL-SHAWD w/Technology Package is very fun to drive while offering interior amenities and technology that are second to none	4
419	2799	The 09 335x is more fun to drive and faster but lacks the interior space and modern amenities	1
419	2800	The 09 Infiniti G37 is faster but lacks the driving refinement and interior space and amenities	4
420	2803	The 2009 BMW 335i is even more fun than my previous 2006 BMW 330i	7
420	2805	The 2009 335i takes an already near perfect design and adds just a little more in a lot of area	2
420	2806	The engine is something you just have to experience by driving the car	4
420	2807	Great power at all speeds and seems to beg to be driven harder	3
420	2808	The handling is great in the curves	5
420	2810	This is not the sluggish iDrive system of the past	3
420	2811	If you are into tech toys and can operate a modern cell phone you will love the new iDrive	5
421	2815	It is a small, efficient urban two passenger transport that has a small footprint but a spacious interior	4
421	2816	Being a Daimler product it has the safety and quality expected	4
421	2817	Having a small Mitsubishi engine, it is no surprise the performance and reliability it has	4
421	2818	Being a European design, it has character and head turning style	3
421	2819	Over all this little car has fulfilled and surpassed every design objective and it is fun to drive around town	3
422	2821	Great ride, love the navigation, easy to use	4
422	2822	Seems to shift strange	2
422	2823	Mileage has not been as good as promised	0
422	2824	Good looking and fun to drive	3
422	2826	Cannot believe that the back bumper is not real chrome	2
423	2829	So far the car is great to drive - very comfortable on road trips - I can drive all day long	5
423	2830	I also bought the upgraded sound system (Boston), best sounding factory installed system I have ever had	1
423	2831	I live in Wisconsin, drove once in the snow earlier this year and I am planning on driving year round - from what I have experienced car should handle as good as any non 4X4 - just have to drive with common sense! Dodge rebates plus lifetime warranty backed by the gov't sealed the deal	4
424	2832	This new CTS made it even less painful to get rid of my old (2006) CTS	5
424	2833	This car is pure pleasure for me	7
425	2838	It has what we felt was the best finishing details/trim and was sportier than the Camry and Fussion	4
426	2846	She loves the Venza! High style, room of an Avalon for adult business associates and friends, space for occasional hauling projects	1
427	2848	Midyear model in midnight sky was the car I wanted after reviewing everything I could about the nissan vs.mazda3,honda civic and toyota corolla	3
427	2851	Interior comfort and roominess was best of the group	1
427	2852	"I am 6'2"" and interior size was important"	1
427	2853	Great acceleration and smooth,seamless transmission, Handling is pretty good and quiet for a small car	4
427	2854	The only negative comments I can make is the oddly shaped rearview mirrors and security alarm going off when unlocking trunk without unlocking doors first	3
427	2855	Otherwise s solid choice.	3
428	2857	It gets over 25 MPG on the Hwy with average speed of 70 MPH, but in town I am very disappointed	0
428	2858	In normal city driving it gets 13 to 14 MPG.	0
429	2860	Had a 2006 sportage and saw the optima and had to have it	4
429	2861	I am blown away at the attention it gets	2
429	2862	People are always telling me they love its looks and the red color is sharp	5
429	2864	The optima feels smooth and plenty of power from the I-4 it only has a few less horse power than the v-6, save a few bucks and buy the I-4	4
429	2865	The trunk really holds a lot and the car is comfortable on long trips	5
429	2866	The gas mileage is as advertised which many cars do not match up	0
430	2870	She's a sweet, boss looking ride	2
430	2871	The 1st one off the rail car from the factory, and we got her! Inferno pearl red is a head turner at every light in town	4
430	2873	The 3.5 high output V6 is not very quick off the line, but very quick to respond after you'er out of 1st gear	4
430	2874	The car feels well balanced and can scream around bends and turns like the best of them	4
430	2875	Outstanding road feel and a rocket on the Hwy	4
430	2876	The G package ( 26G )has larger rims, fog lights, all speed traction control, 4 wheels ABS disc brakes, electronic stability program	3
431	2877	After driving the Mazda6, none of the other cars I tested (Altima, Accord, Legacy, Camry) could match the combination of features/performance/style	3
431	2878	The acceleration is better than I expected with a 4cyl and the suspension has an excellent balance between handling and comfort	3
431	2879	The Michelin tires do squeal too early though	4
431	2880	The dashboard is very intuitive and easy to use	3
431	2881	The GT has more features than I know what to do with	4
431	2882	I especially love the blue tooth connection for my cell phone	1
431	2883	The only minor disappointment is the gas mileage	0
432	2885	I've had my Journey for 3 months and already have had the sunroof, power steering, transmission, and main wiring harnesses worked on	4
432	2886	The oil light came on before 3000 miles and I got the recall about the wiring harness about the same time	0
432	2888	The Power steering was replaced and the transmission started slipping between 1st and 2nd gear also gets stuck in 5th gear and causes my mpg to be about 16.5	0
433	2895	The room in it is exceptional and it has all the comfort features you could want from a luxury car	5
433	2897	Toyota warranties are not as good as Lexus but then they don't break either	6
434	2899	I love my corolla! It's fun and easy to drive	7
434	2900	The car handles well, gets 30 mpg routinely, has cold ac, and the JBL stereo is great	0
434	2901	I think the interior dash design could be upgraded, but that's my only complaint	1
434	2902	With the reliability of Toyota, I'm sure I will be driving this car for many years to come.	6
436	2905	Comfortable car, good to drive powerful 3.5L with V6 engine	4
436	2906	compare to Nissan Maxima and Altima v6 engine and Honda Accord	4
436	2907	I'd rather buy Toyota Camry a little cheaper price and the model look good too 	3
437	2910	On our trips(we've gone twice so far), we average about 40 MPG	0
437	2911	Once we even got 42 MPG!!! The cabin is very quiet and I can actually speak in my normal voice! I love the bluetooth feature	0
437	2913	I love how quiet it is at stop lights	5
437	2914	I can hear myself think!! This car is reliable, and beautiful inside and out	6
437	2915	I also love the 6 cd changer and the separate temperature control	1
438	2919	I needed a vehicle that was roomy enough for me and woulld improve my mpg's	1
438	2921	This vehicle has cut my fuel costs in half	0
438	2922	I was getting about 14MPG in my Jeep GC and am now getting 31MPG in the vue hybrid	0
438	2924	This vehicle has done well even in the mountains	4
438	2925	I hope the vehicle will be reliable considering the high mileage I will be putting on it	6
439	2930	The only thing I do not like is the hardness of the drivers seat	1
439	2931	I can feel something under the padding, perhaps it has something to do with the seat's cooling feature	1
439	2932	I have been driving around for the last 4 months with a thin quilt under me	4
439	2933	This makes it more comfortable	5
439	2934	Hopefully the seats will break in and I can take out the quilt	1
440	2940	The pickup is great in the 2.4 and the ride is quiet	3
440	2941	I have the dark gray and people think it's the small BMW! I trade my cars in every 2-3 year (lease) and always went for the high end 6 cylinder cars	6
440	2943	I love driving it, the ride is really wonderful!	7
441	2945	Love the quality and build	6
441	2946	Very comfortable; rides like a car not a truck	6
441	2947	The Premium sound system in the Limited is among the best I've ever heard (and I drive Lexus) Satellite Radio is nice extra that's standard	1
441	2949	V6 engine is quite sufficient for this vehicle and auto trans is smooth	4
442	2956	We have a Jetta, and needed more room for our growing family	1
442	2957	"While every aspect of it may not be ""German Engineered,"" it surely is ""German Inspired."" The ride is great, the layout inside is well though out (we have a bench instead of the captain's chairs for the 2nd row, much more convenient in my opinion)"	3
443	2960	It flat moves and is stable doing so	3
443	2965	The gas millage isn't anything to write about at this point but it's only got 1000 miles on it	0
444	2969	It rides smoothly, has good fuel economy, and is very fun to drive	4
444	2970	It has a lot of power for its size	4
444	2971	Its handling is tight and is easy to move in tight spaces	3
445	2975	Fast?....oh yea! Handles like a rally car and goes in the snow	4
445	2977	Getting on the freeway is always exciting, 0 to 100 in a flash...I'm in my sixties now and am loving the exhilaration of having a race bred rocket, with the drive- ability for all weather conditions	4
445	2979	Gas mileage? If that's a concern, buy a Prius	0
445	2980	Purchased with the SPT Cat Back exhaust, Short Throw Shifter and Turbo Gauge.Interior Foot-well Lights are a very cool touch	3
446	2982	Zero defects, outstanding mileage	0
446	2983	I think it combines the best combination of mileage, safety, capacity, and price of any vehicle in the U.S	4
446	2987	You could coast for a long time between 35 and 40 mph on electric alone! Mine is still on break-in and the average mileage with AC on half of the time (Miami,FL) is 33.6 mpg	0
446	2988	This is on a mix 50% suburban, 30% city, 20% highway; and American made to boot.	4
447	2991	The 2009 is much improved over the 2001 in terms of build quality	4
447	2992	The 2001 X5 did have mechanical issues	3
448	2996	Even though I like the long term reliability of Honda but I like the style and performance of altima coupe	4
448	2999	Accord coupe is also a beautiful car but I think it is still like a family car	4
449	3001	This car was much more affordable and will cost much less to maintain	6
449	3002	It rides like a car, but has a interior layout like a minivan	1
449	3003	We won't be able to tow a boat or carry an 8' wide piece of plywood, but we never did when we had that capability with our previous minivans	2
449	3004	The kids love it, but we haven't taken the first vacation in it yet, so we may be sacrificing on space and power when the car gets fully loaded with luggage	1
449	3005	I'm a tall guy and I push the limits on most cars	1
449	3006	Leg room and head room could be better, but I fit and I like the feel when I drive.	1
450	3008	It was purchased to deal with the deep winter snows we've been getting here more often	4
450	3009	So, while I'm most interested in utility, finding that the CR-V really handles well, has great road feel and peppy performance is an unexpected bonus	4
450	3010	Gas mileage is higher than I expected, too	0
451	3014	However I find the 2009 to be extremely uncomfortable as compared with the 2008, specifically the lumbar	5
451	3018	This flaw should be corrected but I suspect it will not be because it's not a safety issue.	4
452	3023	At 3500 miles, with majority (~80%) highway driving, the long-term mileage has been 24 mpg	4
452	3024	As the flagship for Hyundai until the Genesis, one clearly senses that a whole lot of thought had gone into the design, and care into the build of this car	3
453	3030	It feels very well put together and is comfortable to drive	5
453	3032	I just wanted basic transportation, reliability, and a price that I could afford	4
454	3035	I was getting between 34-42 MPG when I first got it, but that was being easy on the gas peddle, now, with much more aggressive driving, I'm getting 28-34 MPG	0
455	3039	If you want to save on gas but still want to buy something that's has some style to it, this is your car	0
455	3040	I loved the redesigned look of the latest Camry when it out, and this new 2009 corolla is like a smaller version of the Camry	3
455	3041	The exterior of the S model is beautiful in person, most pictures don't do it justice I think	3
455	3042	The interior is nice and there is plenty of room for a family of five	1
455	3044	The JBL stereo upgrade is well worth it, it sounds great with plenty of deep bass, and the added Bluetooth support that comes with it is a God sent	1
456	3048	Fuel economy supposed to be 18 to 25 MPG	0
456	3049	Just a few days the best MPG so far is 12.5	0
456	3050	Also seating is very firm and hard on the bottom	5
456	3051	Suggest future years Toyota put in a more comfortable seat	5
456	3052	In addition, suggest this great looking car have memory front seating for the driver and passenger	2
456	3053	I've read all the reviews on this vehicle and many other people have stated the same recommendations: (memory seating to include side view mirrors and more comfortable seating	1
458	3060	If you want a great stereo and lumbar support, don't go with the base	1
458	3062	It is a great vehicle that handles well, steering is responsive and I never feel as though my safety is compromised	6
459	3065	Wow! This vehicle is fast 	4
459	3067	And is surprisingly comfortable	5
459	3068	"My wife keeps referring to it as ""awesome"""	2
459	3071	Build quality is superb! VW and Audi have a winner on their hands in my opinion	4
460	3076	If you are looking for a well built, fun to drive and reasonable cost to operate car look at the Honda Civic! The EX model has all the toys you need, sunroof, 4 wheel disc brakes, cruise, and a decent stereo system	2
461	3084	I couldn't be happier as this vehicle fulfills all my needs for a truck - adequate towing, people mover, great ride, good at the lumber yard/garden center - in a 4 wheel drive long lasting Honda package	1
462	3088	A high quality small car! Without the high price	4
462	3089	If you are in the market for a fuel saver but also desire peppy performance with great utility this car is the only way to go	4
463	3095	This truck handles amazing in the snow and ice	4
463	3097	and I have tried! The safety features Toyota put into this truck are really impressive and allow it to handle great in all conditions	4
463	3098	Lots of power, gas mileage is not the best, however, its much better than other trucks out there	0
464	3100	Traded 2001 Passat on my first Acura, not as smooth/quiet of a ride, but for the $$ a good trade off	4
464	3101	Looking for better reliability along with gas mileage	4
464	3102	Last 5 tankfuls have exceeded 33 mpg, country driving 45 to 55 mph for 50 miles R/T per day	0
464	3104	A must look for the $$ with many standard features compared to models in the same class	4
465	3106	This is my fourth Z and is clearly the best in overall performance and can match or outperform almost any sports car on the road	4
465	3107	I test drove a Porsche Boxster the day before I bought the 370Z and it matched its performance as well as being quicker	4
466	3111	I wanted a truck from another manufacture, but due to cost and gas prices we focused on small SUVs	4
466	3113	The one negative was KBB's prediction about resale value (but I keep cars a long time so not a big deal)	4
466	3114	I was impressed by the safety ratings (my number one priority), and liked the safety features available	4
466	3115	The SYNC system is great, it?s easy to see all the way around the vehicle (no blind spots and easy to back up)	4
466	3116	At 60 mph I get 31 mpg, at 80 mph 25mpg; not bad for an SUV	0
466	3117	It's well designed and wonderful to drive (I enjoy my commute now!)	7
466	3118	A great vehicle and a good value (we got it below invoice)	4
467	3121	The comfort level, smooth ride, and power when you need it is what driving a car is all about and this car has it	5
467	3122	It certainly does get the attention from others	4
468	3125	Build quality is excellent and the engine very smooth and powerful	5
469	3130	I've had numerous contacts with Nissan's Consumer Affairs Department, regarding the 370Z Car's need of an ENGINE OIL COOLER	4
469	3131	The 370Z can not handle driving at speeds of 60 MPH, or more, with out the ENGINE OIL TEMPERATURE reaching the 280 degree mark, which is what Nissan indicates is the MAX OIL TEMPERATURE the car should operate at	0
470	3133	I traded a 2007 Toyota Camry SE-V6 for this Murano LE in April and could not be happier! Great styling, excellent performance, fine handling (for an SUV) and decent fuel economy..	4
471	3137	I love this car, got 34 with NO AC on a longer trip, getting 20-22 around town	0
471	3138	Both above EPA estimates for this 2.4 auto	4
471	3139	Love the handling and pep, the styling is distinctive and attractive, many compliments	4
471	3140	On the practical side, hey I never buy a vehicle I can't sleep in, and this is no exception with lots of room, love the folding FPassenger seat	4
471	3142	Its a sporty hatchback/small wagon, and a welcome change from poor mileage with Subaru AWD, which I do not need in Central Virginia	4
472	3144	Sticker 48k yet was out the door tax, title and license for $35500.00 (still can't believe it) Laramie trim is excellent, sound system and hard drive are great	4
472	3146	Very smooth ride	4
472	3147	Built in AC/DC converter is a great feature as well	4
473	3151	I love to drive it just about anywhere	4
473	3152	I bought it with the 6 speed which is quite nice	4
473	3153	Great clutch but shifter is a bit notchy	3
473	3156	I'm getting a solid 23 mpg and more on the highway	0
474	3160	Pretty quick, lots and lots of space..	1
476	3169	and it is still a great car! No problems, great ride & handling, good performance from the 4 cyl	4
476	3170	engine and on highway trips over 37 mpg! Love all the standard features and a warranty that shames Toyota & Honda and many more	0
477	3177	The xD was $2k less than the similarly equipped Fit and the fit/finish and engine performance was much, much better as well	4
477	3180	Handles amazingly well	4
477	3181	Feels sporty and luxurious inside	4
477	3182	Great on the hwy as well as our rural roads	4
477	3183	MPG - solid 31 city (hilly and curvy) and 38 highway	0
478	3186	Yes, there are some minor styling and other changes, but it's still a 2006 technology platform	4
479	3190	It just looked like a grocery getter, bland, wagon-like and just something moms and old ladies would drive	4
479	3191	But the 2009 Vibe caught my eye, particularly the GT trim	4
479	3192	It's sleek, sexy and with the economical yet punchy 2.4 L option, I was sold	4
479	3193	This is the 5 speed automatic version (there's no option for this, hello Edmunds!)	4
479	3194	Small but roomy, powerful but economic (29 MPG on average!), great interior (the seats are SO comfortable), and this car is hot! Getting a lot of stares! I would recommend this car!	4
480	3197	We also enjoyed the extra space the vehicle provided	4
480	3198	We doubted the gas mileage ratings, but after 2 months we believe! We live in a rural area of PA and are getting 28 mpg	0
480	3199	On our first 12 hour trip, we got close to 30 mpg	0
480	3200	We find the leather seats very comfortable and enjoy the bluetooth phone capabilities....no more worries about getting the phone up to the ear! Keyless entry is nice but can be confusing	5
480	3202	Limited with leather is more comfortable than the Base.	5
481	3204	Rides very nice and is very comfortable	5
481	3206	The motor is very quiet and the car is very nice	2
482	3210	I got all of that ? plus a surprise ? great gas mileage	0
482	3211	The overhead multi-info display was showing an average of 27 mpg while driving on the freeway but I expected it was lower	0
482	3212	It turned out to be 25.7 mpg from fill-up to fill- up	0
482	3213	The interior trim looks beautiful	1
482	3215	My other vehicle rattles like crazy over this area but the Sienna does not make a sound and stays in complete control	4
483	3218	BUT, I am disappointed that Honda has not entered the 21st century along with Saturn and other cars by providing remote trunk access with their Civic LX	4
483	3220	So, if you have kids, if you shop and appreciate easy trunk access as you lug items to the car, buy another car	4
485	3226	"Not that I'm over the initial ""ooh & aah"" of having a hybrid, what I have is an excellently running, gas saving vehicle, but a little on the boring side"	0
485	3227	This is not a sports car by any means, and I realized that when I purchased	4
485	3229	"Come time for new tires, I will look into adding on the 18-inch rims and the TRD suspension to ""sport up"" the ride a bit"	4
485	3230	I didn't want the nav system because of not being able to program while car is in drive, so opted for cloth seats, but got everything else with it.	4
486	3238	Design area: No place to put your right arm while driving	4
486	3239	Light in car not good for front light for people in the front seat	3
486	3240	All in all good car for the price and gas needs.	4
487	3242	I had a hard time choosing between the 3 series and the G37 but my wife made the decision easy because she preferred the G37 interior	4
487	3243	The navigation and premium package was a must and because we hadn't bought a new car recently, the blue tooth and backup camera were nice features	3
487	3244	What got us to the dealership though was predicted RELIABILITY and we chose Infiniti based on my wife's positive experience with Nissan.	6
488	3246	It has great fuel economy and is built as good as a BMW in my opinion	0
488	3247	It is great to see that you do not need the v6 (which I had in my last car) to get the quiet ride and good acceleration	4
488	3248	I was looking for a good family 4-door sedan that would also be fun to drive back and forth on my long commute to work (on the congested roads of NJ)	3
488	3249	Based on my budget of 20-25K, I had considered many new cars and also a low mileage BMW used car	4
490	3257	It has a feeling of solid precision at 90 MPH.The handling is excellent.Some reviews have said you have to get used to the CVT.Not me,I got used to it on the test drive.This car has an endless supply of smooth power.Also the car looks gorgeous.I have been getting about 22 miles per gallon with fast driving.	0
491	3258	Having traded my gas-hog GX for a new RX, I am pretty happy overall	0
491	3259	The car is comfortable, sufficiently powerful, and endowed with some features that the GX didn't have (such as HID headlamps that swivel, a power liftgate, and fold-flat second row seats)	4
491	3260	But I am a bit disappointed at the rattling sunroof shade and another rattle emanating from the right front dashboard area	4
491	3261	I try to remind myself that I'm getting better mileage to counteract the annoyance	0
491	3262	But after driving only 300 miles so far, I hope this doesn't foretell a future of other things going wrong.	4
492	3264	I love it so much! The interior is beautiful, and the seats are really comfortable, I love my sun roof, and both of my boys have more than enough room in the back seat	1
492	3265	The trunk is huge! We have an Eddie Bower stroller which is huge in itself and it fits in there with room to spare	4
492	3266	We had to evacuate when hurricane Ike came through last year, we fit one pack&play, three suit cases, stroller, briefcase, big pack of diapers&wipes, small ice chest, dog food, toys, a portable baby swing, sheets and a comforter and it all fit, with more room in there	4
492	3267	It drives so smooth and quiet! I recommend this to anyone!	1
493	3271	It has more power than I'll ever need and very comfortable seating	5
493	3272	My teens vibrate the whole car with their music, but otherwise the sound system in great	3
493	3273	And I found it affordable.	4
494	3274	At first I thought perhaps I was being hypersensitive, but the more I drive may Aura (3.6 engine), the more I hate it	4
495	3281	Gives 30 mpg in very mixed driving	0
495	3284	It's the most car you can put around a 2000cc engine	4
495	3285	Not a rocket ship, but more than enough go for a great daily driver	4
496	3287	Add dual cat back exhaust where I felt more power response	4
496	3289	Thinking about adding cold air intake down the road, I had one problem with mine at 500 miles had a problem with the engine? told me the flywheel was damaged? scary but the dealership fixed it, and had no problems since at least for now the car is great to drive, wish the v6 had a little more power..	4
497	3290	The car looks great! Smooth ride on the highway	2
497	3291	Seats are comfy! Love the chrome finishes on door handles & front grill	5
498	3292	If you're a 'driver' you'll love the steering, suspension and handling	4
498	3293	Plus, the car is tight, engine is smooth and interior is perfect	1
498	3295	HD radio is terrible	1
498	3296	Constantly flips in & out of HD, save your money	1
498	3298	Auto trans is also sketchy	3
498	3299	In sport mode it won't ever go to 6th gear and regular mode just doesn't downshift readily	4
498	3300	If you're doing 40 MPH and step on it, it bogs down unless you press deep on the pedal	0
498	3301	It makes the car feel underpowered	4
498	3303	Had a 330i with 5-spd prior to this and power wise, this is a little disappointing	4
499	3308	I am quite satisfied its styling and convenience	6
499	3309	Platinum Gray Metallic has edge at every corner, awesome color	4
499	3310	I really enjoy tight and rich should of Lexicon	2
500	3316	Comfortable car, features great, and good for road trips	5
501	3320	I owned an accord in the mid 90s so I knew they were reliable	6
501	3322	Since day 2 the check engine engine light has been on and my Honda has seen more of the mechanic in three weeks than my 9 year old Land Rover has in the past year!! It's a shame because the primary reason one purchases a Honda is for its reliability.	4
502	3325	This is a beautiful CUV	2
502	3326	Roomy, luxurious and very eye catching	1
502	3329	I'm so happy with it	7
502	3330	It's a soundproof car drive, but has the size of an SUV	4
503	3334	Chrysler nailed it when they built this baby! The retro styling and big engine take me back to when I had my old muscle cars	4
503	3335	"This car is not about economy, thrift, or ""green"" driving"	0
503	3337	"The only thing that I wasn't prepared for was the ""rock star"" treatment from people everywhere"	4
503	3338	People stop their cars beside mine, the give me the thumbs up, I have even had some guys ask me to pop the hood	4
504	3340	Although the 2009 looks pretty much like every Prius since the 2004 redesign I think it's still a good looking car	4
504	3341	For a small car the interior is spacious, lots of leg room even in the back seat	1
504	3343	The rear seats lay flat opening up the storage space of the hatchback for plenty of storage	5
504	3344	Up front there are two glove compartments, a small compartment under the radio, a sunglasses compartment overhead, and two large compartments between the seats	5
504	3345	On the road I find the Prius has plenty of get-up-and-go when needed and the touchscreen display gives me the feedback I need to maximize my fuel economy	4
505	3346	Smooth ride, comfortable seating, plenty of space to take the family on a twelve hour ride to our vacation destination, then twelve hours home	5
505	3347	This vehicle is worth a serious look for those considering the large SUV	2
505	3349	The hemi has smooth fluid acceleration and alot of power.	0
506	3350	All I can say about this car is that it has everything you need and more and for 2009 they have really cut down on wind and engine noise from 2007 and for 2010 they are getting a new interior.	4
507	3352	The car has a lot of speed for a 4 cyl and also it has a sport gear	5
507	3353	The interior is really comfortable, and I so far have not had any blind spots! Could not ask for more in a car! 	2
508	3355	I loved that car, it had great styling, performance, and gas mileage (in the last two regards, it still beats my new Benz)	4
509	3360	True the Altima handled better than the Camry, but the Altima was noisy and the gas engine continously cycled in and out of operation	2
509	3361	By comparison, the Camry is quieter, the gas engine only cycles at appropriate times and the ride is quieter than the Altima	4
509	3362	It is clear to me that the Camry Hybrid is a more sophisticated implementation of hybrid technology.	0
510	3363	Car is great looking and is great on fuel as well	0
510	3364	The lights go on automatically when it gets dark and with the sun roof the Gt 2009 Pontiac Vibe is an eye catcher	4
510	3366	Has so many neat items that all work very well	1
510	3367	AC works great, heater is great, wiper at the rear window is great, heater in the back window is helpful on a cold day to see things with the rear view mirror	3
510	3368	Has a great radio and a jack to enter ones own music	1
511	3373	I like that it has the height of a truck with the feel of a car	2
512	3375	This is a great looking car	3
512	3377	But the car simply has the worst ride of any vehicle I've owned	3
513	3385	I have some upgrades from the king ranch and platinums I test drove; I am getting the dvd headrests and the dealer is obtaining a lexan roll-up bed cover, which all pickups should have	4
513	3386	"We ordered the white sand tri-coat metallic and the 20"" KR wheels, navigation/Sync and moonroof"	4
513	3387	The whole thing is a luxurious work truck that does a fair job of passing as a limousine	5
513	3388	Wonderful blend of technology, industrial design, strength, beauty and versatility	4
514	3392	Took it to ski for a week at a resort 125 miles away, it handled the slick roads at the resort with no problem (4WD) the v6 is very good,and it's nowhere near broken in	4
514	3393	"The 6 speed tranny is wonderful; smooth shifts, timing is great and will get better as it ""learns"", I'm told"	4
514	3394	Mileage on first trip, to, from and around the ski resort was 23.4 mpg, all in cold snowy weather	0
515	3397	Mileage is unbelievably good	0
515	3398	Through the old miles driven divided by gallons used, my lowest tank has been 18.4 while the highest was 24.9(all highway, 70- 80mph)	0
515	3399	I look at the computer's mileage, and it's close, but usually higher than actual	0
515	3403	The car is a hot rod in family disguise...love it...	4
516	3406	The Camry Hybrid averaged 35 miles per gallon and was a bit uncomfortable, not fun to drive, and most of all I felt that the current hybrid hoopla will soon be looked upon like a fad as new technology is introduced	0
516	3407	"The '09 TSX gets ""near"" what I got with the Camry Hybrid, but is more fun and the intention is to drive it to 150k+ miles like I did with my 97 TL (my 03 MDX has 80k miles on it)"	4
516	3408	Have two small kids and the backseat, of course, has slightly less room than the Camry - biggest con, but expected longevity and drive make up for it	4
517	3411	I love the ride on this truck, going over rail crossing used to upset the back end of the 2007 ram, but not in this truck, its great that they finally made an interior to compete with Ford and Chevy	4
517	3412	I cannot believe how quiet this truck is compared to others that i have owned, diving down the interstate at 80, there is no wind noise at all	4
518	3414	I love driving this car! We purchased the 3.8 with the tech package & tinted windows	4
518	3415	It got great mileage on a recent trip	0
518	3416	Enjoy the quiet ride	7
518	3417	Definitely a luxury vehicle	1
519	3419	This has the luxury for the needed night out and the toughness expected	1
520	3423	I recently purchased an '09 6i Touring with the 6 CD changer & moonroof, along with a rear spoiler	1
520	3426	The ride is very quiet, and I get good gas mileage (1600 mi, ~24mpg combined.) The acceleration is great, most noticeably between 50mph - 75mph, even in auto	0
520	3427	The braking is excellent too	4
520	3428	As nimble as my 3i was, I feel like the 6i has excellent handling for it's larger size	5
520	3429	I've also fit 4 grown adults in the car, and they've all commented how much legroom they have	5
521	3432	I wanted a Hybrid vehicle, but also desired 4-wheel drive for the winter weather	4
521	3434	The driving is smooth	4
521	3435	I average 20 mpg around town, which includes some interstate driving	0
521	3436	The vehicle is solid with all the luxury features one would desire	3
522	3438	Ok I was so happy at first - never owned a car this nice......never judge a book by its cover they say....it has been in the shop for brake sensor recall, warped rotors X3! MIGIG crashed	4
522	3439	Now it's sitting in the driveway the past month pending Lemon Law for the rotors	4
522	3440	Us brakes and rotors people got to find each other and DO something about it	4
523	3442	Of all the xDrive BMWs I've owned or even driven, this one is a sublime blend of sure footed panther and raging bull	4
523	3444	It feels like it's hand made on the inside and looks like it was left behind by advanced intelligence from another galaxy	2
523	3445	Drove both engine sizes and went with the big one 5.0 V-8	3
523	3446	The roar alone justified my decision	4
523	3450	This is for a single individual to get out and have fun quickly	1
523	3451	Sport package is a must on this car	4
523	3452	So is Technology package	4
523	3453	Logic 7 premium sound is a hedge against any conversation	4
524	3456	Very practical	4
524	3457	Lots of compliments from retirees	2
525	3463	I opted for the base package that includes a moonroof, power seats, 6 disc changer, 18 inch wheels, and cloth seats (although they are more like microfiber)	3
526	3466	I love the styling and it looks fantastic when cared for	2
526	3468	I drive very aggressively and still get great gas mileage	0
526	3470	It preforms pretty well, however dogs slightly until you get to 40+ mph	0
527	3473	The only problem I have is with the driver's seat	1
527	3474	"I'm 5'8"" and find the seat extremely uncomfortable, digging into my leg underneath and my foot falls off the pedal to the right"	5
528	3479	Very reliable vehicle	6
528	3480	The navigation system is easy to use and access while driving (all touch screen)	4
528	3481	Very powerful car, good acceleration	4
528	3482	The backup camera is a nice feature, but the images appear farther than it actually is	4
528	3483	Have no problem driving in sleet/snow/ice thus far.	4
529	3489	I sometimes wish I would've splurged and gotten the one with the sunroof	3
529	3490	The car is great in city and hwy and I'm amazed at how well it insulates outside noise	4
529	3491	Feels very solid throughout	2
529	3493	I had an issue with a faulty fuel pump which was quickly replaced under warranty	0
530	3495	A very nice new and fresh design	2
530	3496	Very comfortable	5
530	3497	Excellent features like the sync, vista roof and refrigerator	4
530	3500	Build the right car and people will buy it - what a concept! I have already influenced three others to but this vehicle	4
531	3505	It also has a nice back seat	1
531	3508	The TSX's motor is superior to that of the IS 250 and A4 IMO	4
531	3509	It has similar real world performance capabilities and gets better mileage	4
532	3513	I got the SL package on my 2.5S and am only mildly content with the performance vs	4
532	3517	Ride is great, styling and value are better than Accd/Camry/Mazda6	3
532	3519	Still think the mileage for either is great.	0
533	3520	Had this car for 24 hours and I have buyers remorse due to horrible road noise coming into the car	1
533	3521	It doesn't happen on every pavement but on most	5
533	3522	The noise is just horrible	4
533	3523	The pavement near the dealer is new and so the noise was not noticeable there	4
535	3533	By far this 09 is the best! All the elements have come together in a great pickup	3
535	3534	Ride is exceptional, power and performance outstanding under any conditions and it looks good too! I have driven city, highway, off road, good and bad weather and this pickup has not disappointed! I have the TRD Offroad PKG (can't live without my 4x4) with Towing	4
535	3535	Interior controls are easy to reach and read with a quiet ride for a 4x4	1
536	3538	The Camry is awesome, quiet, powerful engine, good looking, well laid out interior, and it does not vibrate and shake like the Accord did! The 440 watt JBL stereo system sounds very nice, and the bluetooth option is way cool	4
536	3539	A recent road trip at speeds of 75+mph achieved 29.5 miles per gallon! And when you want to accelerate, hold on! There is a reason for so many of them are on the road - drive one - oh what a feeling!	0
537	3540	This car feels bigger than it is	3
537	3542	The back seat is very comfortable for two	5
537	3543	Three might be pushing it	1
537	3544	Fun to drive and handles nicely on our twisty turny up and down roads we encounter daily	6
537	3545	Gas mileage, 27 to 33, has been above expectations and will only improve as it breaks in	0
538	3548	"I put 20"" chrome wheels on"	2
538	3549	I drive 60 miles per day, half highway at about 80 mph	0
538	3550	City driving is fantastic, electric motor up to 40mph 4 wheeel drive cuts mpg but I average 28 mpg for the 600 miles driven 	0
539	3552	Quality is good	4
539	3553	The only problem I have noticed so far is the tracking at highway speeds is a bit loose - that is, it wanders off desired track easily and steering is a little twitchy, especially in even a slight cross wind	4
539	3554	I haven't driven it enough to develop an opinion about the gas mileage, reliability or other operation aspects	6
540	3555	Very solid performance, smooth riding, good brake, good acceleration	4
540	3556	However, I found the building quality is not so good	4
541	3558	Fun to drive, plenty of power, front seats are excellent, built tight, looks great, lots of extras, terrific value for the money	2
542	3562	This car may not be quite in that class but it's hella more fun to drive than the trucks and SUVs I've had over the past 20 years or so	4
542	3563	My reliability rating is based on only 1 week of ownership, but so far so good	6
543	3567	The cylinder shutdown feature works as advertised, and doesn't really interfere with driving	3
543	3568	Ergonomics in the driving position are excellent	1
543	3569	The electronics are really good, and the sensors help with maneuvering at low speeds	1
543	3570	Room is very good in back (why we bought it in the first place).	1
544	3571	For something with the aerodynamics of an apartment building, this thing is a nice ride	4
544	3572	It's exceptionally quiet, even over marginal pavement or at higher speeds	4
544	3573	Seats are extremely comfortable even after several hours of driving	5
544	3574	Interior is very roomy - even the 3rd row	1
544	3575	I had a 6-foot co-worker back there, and with the 2nd row shifted forward slightly, he said it was comfortable enough for a cross-town jaunt	5
544	3576	Engine has a enough grunt to cruise very nicely at 90MPH	4
544	3577	Ride is smooth with minimal body roll on turns	4
544	3578	The build and design are typical Honda - everything's well laid out (overall), and controls and surfaces have a good tactile feel - some minor styling quibbles (IMHO.) 	3
545	3579	Owned BMWs for 11-yrs; got tired of expensive fixes	6
545	3580	The Mazda has creature comforts not typically found in this class	5
545	3581	Leather, heated seats, remote starter, Bose upgraded stereo, 4-wheel disc brakes	1
545	3582	Very fun to drive, way better looking than anything in it's class (Honda Fit, Corolla, Civic)	2
545	3584	The interior fit and finish matches BMWs I've owned	1
545	3585	I researched cars for about a week solid before purchasing and nothing comes close to the bang for the buck	2
545	3586	The one major complaint - the horn sounds like something from a clown car.	3
546	3588	It has great looks, ride, and mileage	3
547	3592	(The '06 is still in the family, and my previous Legacies have made it to the high 200ks with one at 330k - without major repair.) I felt the ride on the '06 was hard & sharp, but the '09 has smoothed that	4
547	3593	I feel it is still firm - not soft like the review stated	1
547	3594	The driver's seat position has always given me more room than I need (6'1)	1
547	3595	"Although I like the outside ""look"", I'm one of the few who felt the '06 was original and creative (Alfa-Romeo comes to mind)"	2
547	3597	"As for interior space, if you need more room, buy a ""box."""	2
548	3599	It's the best of both worlds, you can just cruise or drive it hard and it responds flawlessly no matter what! The 7AT helps with the gas mileage and is fun to drive in the manual mode! Coming from a Maxima I expect the same reliability as well.	4
549	3601	The looks, sport ride, electronics, etc., etc., are outstanding	3
549	3602	It's so quiet I have to watch my speed!! The 4 banger with the 6M is a great match	4
549	3603	The thought that has gone into the interior lay out is impressive	1
550	3605	Overall car is fun to drive, the performance is what you would expect from a BMW car	4
550	3606	The appointments in the car are first class, but there is one thing that I see lately, which has frustrated me, and many other people on the Bimmerfest forum's...that is a terrible whining noise coming from the transmission or differential....drives people crazy !!! I seen the same issue now on 5 Series and 7 Series cars, and BMW doesn't seem to care about this, but it totally frustrates many people that have spent a lot of CASH!!!	3
551	3607	My old SL Saturn has been showing signs of dying for years, so I hit the internet looking for a new replacement	4
551	3608	I stumbled upon the Fit completely by accident, but fell in love with it after reading several reviews and the specs on it	7
551	3610	"27, I've been having a blast with my new Blackberry Sport and it just seems to be getting better! Driving to work is fun again, fuel economy is fantastic, and with all I can do with the back seat/cargo area, I'm set for just about anything! I will admit the price was a bit much, but just over 5k after, this was the BEST investment I could have made! To quote the commercial, ""The Fit Is GO!!!!"""	5
552	3612	After 2 months transmission fluid started leaking, noticed oil marks on my garage floor	0
552	3613	Took to dealer - they had to open the whole transmission and check inside	1
552	3614	"The problem was a faulty ""O"" ring which was causing the leak"	6
552	3616	The dealer had to remove the whole transmission, unlink it with the engine, opened up everything connected to the engine to get to the faulty O ring	5
552	3618	I have Lexus SUV as well and it far exceeds Acura from performance and reliability.	4
553	3620	Flash to pass is on this vehicle and it works with the HID high beams, I believe an industry first	4
553	3621	Bluetooth is standard	1
553	3622	It is now impossible to step on the brake and gas pedal at the same time	4
553	3623	There is a single address book for the Bluetooth, navigation and OnStar systems	3
553	3626	Only the CTS DI AWD has the interior luxury of the Lexus (done in the distinctly GM style), the performance and efficiency of the direct injection engine (it runs on regular gas) and handling characterics of a European sedan.	4
554	3628	We knew we were going to get a Subaru, and settled on the Forester, but ended up with Tribeca because of the size of the back seat (can sit between two large carseats comfortably), and a great deal on this model	5
554	3629	Initially was not interested in Tribeca because of the high octane fuel requirement, which apparently changed this MY	5
554	3630	Took on its first long road trip, and so far has been extremely comfortable and fun to drive	4
554	3631	It has everything we were looking for in a long-distance vehicle	4
554	3632	The safety features are certainly a great selling point	5
554	3633	There aren't many options/accessories that we feel are missing	4
554	3634	Nice, solid vehicle!	2
555	3637	Best when merging into the highway	4
555	3638	Cabin ergonomics are top rated	1
556	3643	The car constantly hunts between cylinders and when not on cruise control and is the most irritating thing I have ever experienced	5
557	3648	After driving around 500-680miles on a tank of gas to going to 400-475miles I was less than impressed	4
557	3649	"I'm 6'4"" and this car is less roomy than my Accord.I feel extremely cramped while i'm sitting here typing this headed to florida from North Carolina (co-worker driving 1st shift)"	2
557	3651	Interior not so pretty but its a rental so I'll suffice	2
557	3652	The radio is lacking features also	1
557	3653	Steering is much sloppier than the accord	4
557	3654	It does have a smooth ride too.	4
558	3656	I kept careful records on the trip to Texas and my overall mileage was 33.8 mpg	0
558	3657	Understand that many of these miles were at 75-85 mph across West Texas, AZ and NM	4
558	3658	It is a great driver, long days on the interstate were comfortable	5
558	3661	This car is a technological marvel.	4
559	3663	Outstanding power with great mileage per gallon	0
560	3668	I really enjoy driving it	7
561	3669	I bought the black on black fully loaded, every option version and couldn't be more happy	2
562	3672	What's amazing about this 2.5 all wheeler is the fact that on a trip from Colorado to South Dakota in my first month of ownership, I averaged 33 mpg highway and 28 mpg city	0
562	3673	For all wheel drive, this is spectacular mileage in a quality vehicle	0
562	3674	No rattles, very little wind noise, all the bells whistles I need and then some.	4
563	3678	This car is absolutely one of the best handling, best looking, best built cars I've ever driven	2
563	3679	I have the 2.4 cylinder, but the performance is as if a 6 cylinder is under the hood! It is so quiet, sometimes I can't believe it's running	4
563	3680	I love the looks of the instrument cluster, very nostalgic	2
564	3691	Not as fast (or flashy) as the Acura, BUT, it is so nimble and just plain fun to drive	4
564	3692	The folding rear seats (up and flat) allow for an AMAZING amount of room! Don't miss the Acura at all	1
564	3693	Average just around 37-38 mpg in city driving..	0
565	3699	We're hooked on the XM radio, love the dual zone climate controls and are very impressed with the overall room of the interior	1
565	3700	We were looking forward to having the class 3 trailer hitch, but were sorely disappointed with the fact that just the Honda trailer wire harness is $181 dollars for a 2 foot harness under the bumper(?!)	4
565	3704	Happy with the handling, but our Pilot pulls to the right on level ground at constant speed	5
566	3706	This is my 6th BMW in the last 20 years, and I'm in love all over again with my car!! The sport package is worth the price, and the new IDRIVE nav system is much improved over the 2006 model.	7
567	3710	The elevated seating is awesome	1
567	3711	The Sirius satellite radio is great	1
567	3712	Good MPG	0
567	3713	The Chill Zone is cool	7
568	3720	I am really enjoying our new Mazda5, but I am not overly amazed	7
568	3722	Our small, umbrella stroller doesn't even fit! I know we will out grow this soon, but it is fun for now.	3
569	3724	My only concern and something Hyundai doesn't seem to be able to resolve is the IPOD port	1
569	3725	I have connected 3 different IPODs in and none worked	1
569	3726	The only music that played was some MP3 songs no Itunes	1
569	3727	I went to my local dealer who couldn't resole the issue I contacted Hyundai directly and the response I got was to go to another dealer to have them look at it, even though that dealer is over 50 miles away	4
569	3728	So still no answer to why the IPOD port doesn't work.	1
570	3731	Its performace is awesome and not to mention its outside and inside design	4
570	3733	The Sync system is great and if you are into technology, you will enjoy it even more	1
571	3736	None are better than the Genesis! The quality is awesome, the car is solid & extremely quiet, the performance is great and the price is low for what the car offers! It has all the features of a twice as expensive car + 5 years full warranty	4
571	3737	The interior is as big as Lexus LS and BMW 7 series and the quality is just as good! I?ve been driving it for 1 month now and I can?t find any flaws	1
572	3742	MPG is great	0
572	3743	Even with my wife's heavy foot, the car still gets 24mpg in town and we get 32 on the highway loaded down for a trip going 70mph	0
572	3744	My GLS did not come with the auto on/off headlights but you can still leave the headlights turned on all the time and they will go off when you turn the engine off and remove the key	2
572	3746	But if value means more to you than people judging you by the coolness of your car, then the Sonata is for you.	2
573	3749	I am very happy with the new model and the significant improvement in ride quality and technical advances over the previous model I owned	3
573	3750	The miles per gallon has improved by about 15% over the old model, 16 mpg is achieved now with a 50/50 mix of highway and city driving	0
573	3751	The bluetooth cell option automatically turns down the radio and ventilation noises to permit an easy conversation	4
573	3752	It is easy to store telephone numbers and make cell calls over bluetooth	3
574	3753	When driving my new Mazda 6(I've had it two weeks) with the rear windows down there is severe buffeting and air pressure that caused the eardrums of three of us to hurt even though we only were subjected to this phenomenon for about 10 seconds	4
574	3755	Anyone else have this problem? If so, what did you do? Did you call Mazda and what was their response? Also, I calculated the mileage I got driving locally and it was 23.7 MPG although the car's computer indicated 18.8 MPG	0
574	3756	I really like my Mazda 6 overall with the minor exception of the buffeting issue noted above.Ha 	4
575	3758	Others had visability issus, headrest issues and even the ease of getting into the back seat	6
575	3760	I don't get the gas mileage that they say (26 highway) as I am only getting 22.7 at best and I am not a speed demon	0
575	3761	Even driving alone I don't get the gas milage	0
575	3763	Others seem to be getting the better gas milage	0
575	3764	I would also like to see the front seats maybe an inch or so longer in lengh	1
576	3766	This car is quiet and fun to drive	4
576	3767	I love the DVD system with the wireless headphones for the kids	1
576	3768	The interior space is not much smaller than my Ford Expedition that I traded in	1
576	3769	I actually have more cargo room while all 7 seats are up than before	1
577	3773	I drove the FX and the feel was much more sporty	5
577	3774	However, the trunk space sacrifice was unacceptable	5
578	3778	The price was great for such a reliable car	6
578	3779	It is not only reliable but can be quick and great on gas	6
579	3780	We have had our van for one week now and just got back from a long road trip	1
579	3784	Meanwhile I have enjoyed listening to Sirius sattelite radio in the front without having to listen to the sounds of race cars and explosions from the rear	1
580	3790	Handling, fun good looking vehicle	7
580	3792	A little louder but you give up a little quiteness for an suv	4
581	3795	I've never liked a car as much as I like this one; it's fierce!	2
582	3798	It's an eye catcher on the main roads, and a performing BEAST on the back roads!	3
583	3801	The outside is awesome and the v6 engine is especially peppy being a 4.0	2
583	3803	the interior is fairly cheezy	1
583	3804	the glovebox is pretty small (my old Dodge neon had a larger and more functional glovebox) and the center console is also kind of impractical, but all around it is more of a sportcar than anything else, so it is nothing to really get picky over	3
583	3805	also they used a lot more cheap plastic than i would of liked	3
584	3809	One thing I never really cared for was that Mustangs were so small and had no room for family, they also rode a little ruff after a while, definitly not a dailey driver or for road trips	3
584	3812	As much as it weighs, this thing is still fast, and so smooth at the same time	4
584	3813	Such a head turner.	4
585	3814	I have driven 30,000 miles in the deserts of Las Vegas and get 22 -23 MPG aroung town and 26 - 28 on the highway	0
585	3819	Look up brakes on the Toureg and you will see every 15k to 20k miles at 4 times the cost of the Tiguan	0
585	3820	This SUV has been flawless, you cannot go wrong	5
585	3821	I test drove the CRV and love the looks, however, the interior seemed cheap and the ride was not as quite	1
586	3823	I traded my 2008 Nissan Rogue SL AWD ater 21K miles for this Tiguan SE 4motion because of the better features, ride, handling, acceleration, and build quality.The car is the best engineering product I have found in the market today for the money	4
586	3824	VW truly is the best kept secret in terms of quality,features,value, and fun to drive	3
587	3828	Hey this car handles awesome and is super comfortable	5
587	3829	The fat wheel looks burly	2
587	3830	I like the electronics and computer stuff	1
587	3831	Sound system is way better than I expected, and I am a picky guy	1
587	3833	When I got the X5 my blackberry connected easily with the bluetooth	7
587	3834	With Mercedes, blue tooth only worked with Motorola and Verizon	1
587	3836	BMW beats Mercedes in handling and steering in my book	5
588	3839	First benefit is the average MPG for my first week of 29.4! Great styling, performance and comfort	0
589	3842	The ride is comfortable yet responsive	5
589	3843	The interior is ample	1
589	3844	I'm built like an NFL defensive end and I'm very comfortable	5
589	3845	The amenities are numerous, you get a lot with the standard package	3
589	3847	The trunk is spacious	1
589	3848	The V-6 290 bhp engine is as smooth as butter on a hot muffin and you can cruise at 80 mph without nary a concern	0
589	3849	An All-Wheel drive version would be too sweet! The stereo system is very nice, audiophile worthy	1
589	3850	"A great buy if you're into affordable luxury and you tend not to follow the ""label""."	3
590	3851	Probably one of the quietest cars in it's class	4
590	3852	Stunning with the 19 in chrome wheels	2
590	3853	More storage than I could ever use	3
590	3854	I love the green LED floor board lights, handy if you drop something	1
590	3855	A fun car to drive...love that Auto Stick...I'm used to rowing my own gears	7
590	3856	Cool the way the middle seats pop up and forward out of the way	1
590	3857	The wide opening door are great getting grandma in and out but you must watch the kids opening them to far in tight parking lots	3
591	3861	From the exterior design, to the interior comfort to the superb V6, this car delivers	1
591	3862	I'm averaging 24.8 MPG in combined city/hwy driving	0
591	3863	I'm averaging a shocking 27.3 on the hwy using the recommended 93 octane	4
591	3864	The engine is tuned for nothing less than 93 octane fuel	0
591	3865	I love the handling, the fit & finish are excellent	5
592	3873	It looks amazing	2
592	3874	It rides beautifully	2
592	3875	Sync is just incredible	1
592	3876	Your IPod plugs right in for Sync	1
592	3877	You don't even need the six CD changer	3
592	3878	It handles well	5
592	3879	I feel so safe in this car	7
593	3886	Maybe I am too much of a Chevy man with some bias, but this is one great vehicle to drive and ride in with excellent build quality	5
593	3887	We got the LTZ in Black Raven (I think that is what it's called) and it has some metallic it in	4
593	3888	Beautiful especially in the sun	2
594	3891	The 4 banger is not that powerful but I did get it for the gas mileage (which is great on highway!)	4
594	3892	Still has pick-up and I don't find it too noisey	5
595	3895	If you want reliability and economy, you choose the right car	6
595	3896	If you want a luxury car with bell and whistles - forget it	4
595	3897	I love this car for the gas mileage and reliability	6
595	3898	I get anywhere from 33 to 36 miles a gallon 50/50 city and hwy driving - mostly no air conditioner	0

595	3902	I use this car for work, so I needed a reliable car with good gas mileage	6
595	3903	The seats are OK, not very comfortable, but good enough	5
596	3905	Performance-enough to keep me satisfied	4
596	3907	Interior-6' 200lbs guy here, more than comfortable	1
596	3908	Quality-right materials used in all the right places	3
596	3909	MPG's-runs on 87 octane and averages 27-28 city, can't complain! Haven't hit the highway yet.	0
597	3911	Add stopping, turning, reliability, gadgets to my old 71 Cuda and you scratch the surface of what this car is	6
597	3912	Although a little porky due to all the gadgets and safety equipment, this baby still performs well	4
597	3913	The car gets more attention than anything out there and in case someone didn't notice stomp on it and the 6 speed version roars loauder than the auto since the suitcase muffler is deleted	4
597	3914	The car handles well and the performance gauges show some of my roadcourse results with 0.99 lateral acceleration	4
598	3920	I got Black, and I like the exterior styling	2
598	3921	With tinted windows, it's a sharp car	3
